        OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n<BR><BR> As a preliminary matter, it will readily
        be understood by one having ordinary skill in the relevant art (\"Ordinary
        Artisan\") that the present invention has broad utility and application.  Furthermore,
        any embodiment discussed and identified as\nbeing \"preferred\" is considered
        to be part of a best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention.
        \ Other embodiments also may be discussed for additional illustrative purposes
        in providing a full and enabling disclosure of the present\ninvention.  Moreover,
        many embodiments, such as adaptations, variations, modifications, and equivalent
        arrangements, will be implicitly disclosed by the embodiments described herein
        and fall within the scope of the present invention.\n<BR><BR> Accordingly,
        while the present invention is described herein in detail in relation to one
        or more embodiments, it is to be understood that this disclosure is illustrative
        and exemplary of the present invention, and is made merely for the\npurposes
        of providing a full and enabling disclosure of the present invention.  The
        detailed disclosure herein of one or more embodiments is not intended, nor
        is to be construed, to limit the scope of patent protection afforded the present
        invention,\nwhich scope is to be defined by the claims and the equivalents
        thereof.  It is not intended that the scope of patent protection afforded
        the present invention be defined by reading into any claim a limitation found
        herein that does not explicitly appear\nin the claim itself.\n<BR><BR> Thus,
        for example, any sequence(s) and/or temporal order of steps of various processes
        or methods that are described herein are illustrative and not restrictive.
        \ Accordingly, it should be understood that, although steps of various processes
        or\nmethods may be shown and described as being in a sequence or temporal
        order, the steps of any such processes or methods are not limited to being
        carried out in any particular sequence or order, absent an indication otherwise.
        \ Indeed, the steps in such\nprocesses or methods generally may be carried
        out in various different sequences and orders while still falling within the
        scope of the present invention.  Accordingly, it is intended that the scope
        of patent protection afforded the present invention is\nto be defined by the
        appended claims rather than the description set forth herein.\n<BR><BR> Additionally,
        it is important to note that each term used herein refers to that which the
        Ordinary Artisan would understand such term to mean based on the contextual
        use of such term herein.  To the extent that the meaning of a term used\nherein--as
        understood by the Ordinary Artisan based on the contextual use of such term--differs
        in any way from any particular dictionary definition of such term, it is intended
        that the meaning of the term as understood by the Ordinary Artisan should\nprevail.\n<BR><BR>
        Furthermore, it is important to note that, as used herein, \"a\" and \"an\"
        each generally denotes \"at least one,\" but does not exclude a plurality
        unless the contextual use dictates otherwise.  Thus, reference to \"a picnic
        basket having an apple\"\ndescribes \"a picnic basket having at least one
        apple\" as well as \"a picnic basket having apples.\" In contrast, reference
        to \"a picnic basket having a single apple\" describes \"a picnic basket having
        only one apple.\"\n<BR><BR> When used herein to join a list of items, \"or\"
        denotes \"at least one of the items,\" but does not exclude a plurality of
        items of the list.  Thus, reference to \"a picnic basket having cheese or
        crackers\" describes \"a picnic basket having cheese\nwithout crackers\",
        \"a picnic basket having crackers without cheese\", and \"a picnic basket
        having both cheese and crackers.\" Finally, when used herein to join a list
        of items, \"and\" denotes \"all of the items of the list.\" Thus, reference
        to \"a picnic\nbasket having cheese and crackers\" describes \"a picnic basket
        having cheese, wherein the picnic basket further has crackers,\" as well as
        describes \"a picnic basket having crackers, wherein the picnic basket further
        has cheese.\"\n<BR><BR> Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals
        represent like components throughout the several views, the preferred embodiments
        of the present invention are next described.  The following description of
        the preferred embodiment(s) is\nmerely exemplary in nature and is in no way
        intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.\n<BR><BR> FIG.
        1 is a side perspective view of the elements of a modular table tennis game
        set 10 in accordance with the preferred embodiments of the present invention.
        \ The game set 10 includes two table modules 20, two paddles 12, and a ball
        14.  The\npaddles 12 and ball 14 may each be of the type conventionally used
        to play the game of table tennis, often known as ping-pong.  In at least one
        proposed commercial embodiment, the elements shown in FIG. 1 are packaged
        and sold together; however, it will\nbe apparent that the table modules 20
        may be sold with or without the other elements, and likewise may be sold individually
        or in larger groups, all without departing from the scope of the present invention.\n<BR><BR>
        Each table module 20 includes a top member 22, preferably having a playing
        surface 24 of a composition conventionally used for table tennis playing surfaces,
        supported by a tripod 26.  The tripod 26 may be of generally conventional
        tripod\nconstruction including three legs 28 whose length is adjustable, a
        center post 30 supported by the legs 28, and an adjustable mounting assembly
        32 supported by the center post 30 and adapted to support the top member 22.
        \ More particularly, a first part\nof the adjustable mounting assembly 32
        is rotatable relative, to a second part, around at least one axis of rotation
        34 such that the top member 22 may be tilted as discussed hereinbelow.\n<BR><BR>
        FIG. 2 is a side perspective view of one of the table modules 20 of FIG. 1
        illustrating a first mode of play.  In particular, FIG. 2 illustrates a one-person
        game wherein a player stands at a location 40 that is a chosen distance from
        the table\nmodule 20, holding a paddle 12, and strikes the ball 14 with the
        paddle 12 such that it flies through the air and hits the playing surface
        24, bounces in the air and flies back toward the player.  The mounting assembly
        32 may be adjusted by rotating the\nportion to which the top member 22 is
        mounted around the axis 34 so as to tilt the top member 22 an appropriate
        amount to cause the ball 14 to bounce back toward the player at a desired
        angle.  The mounting assembly 32 may be capable of infinite\nadjustment or
        it may be arranged to provide one or more preset positions, representing preset
        angles, from which the player can select the desired tilt.\n<BR><BR> The player
        may adjust his or her location 40 as necessary to strike the ball successfully,
        such as by moving forward, backward or side-to-side.  The player may challenge
        himself or herself to repeat the sequence described above as many times in\na
        row as possible or may merely repeat the sequence a desired number of times
        at different angles so as to improve his table tennis skills generally.\n<BR><BR>
        FIG. 3 is a side perspective view of the table modules 20 of FIG. 1 illustrating
        a second mode of play.  In particular, FIG. 3 illustrates another one-person
        game wherein a player stands at a location 40 a chosen distance from one side
        of a\nfirst table module 20, oriented generally horizontally, with a second
        table module 20, oriented generally vertically, positioned a chosen distance
        from the opposite side of the first table module 20.  These orientations may
        be achieved once again by\nrotating each respective top member 22 around its
        axis 34 to the desired orientation.  If preset positions are to be provided,
        representing preset angles, it is preferred that two of the preset positions
        that are provided are those necessary to place the\ntop member 22 at a horizontal
        orientation and to place the top member 22 at a vertical orientation.\n<BR><BR>
        In the game illustrated in FIG. 3, the player strikes the ball 14 with the
        paddle 12 such that it flies through the air and hits the playing surface
        24 of the second table module 20, bounces back toward the playing surface
        24 of the first table\nmodule 20, and from there flies back toward the player.
        \ Once again, the player may adjust his or her location 40 as necessary to
        strike the ball successfully, such as by moving forward, backward or side-to-side.
        \ The player may challenge himself or\nherself to repeat the sequence described
        above as many times in a row as possible or may merely repeat the sequence
        a desired number of times at different angles so as to improve his table tennis
        skills generally.\n<BR><BR> Alternatively, if only one table module 20 is
        available, or if the player wishes to enjoy a different playing experience,
        other vertical surfaces, such as an interior wall in a house or the like,
        may be substituted for the second table module\n20.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 4 is a
        side perspective view of the elements of the modular table tennis game set
        10 of FIG. 1 illustrating a third mode of play.  In particular, FIG. 4 illustrates
        a two-person game wherein a first player, holding a paddle 12, stands at a\nlocation
        40 a chosen distance from a first table module 20, and a second player, also
        holding a paddle 12, stands at a location 41 a chosen distance from a second
        table module 20.  Each table is oriented generally horizontally, and the two
        table modules\n20 are spaced a desired distance apart.  Generally speaking,
        the greater the distance between the table modules 20, the more difficult
        it may be for each player to hit their opponent's table surface 24 with his
        or her shots.\n<BR><BR> To play, the first player strikes the ball 14 with
        the paddle 12 such that it flies through the air and hits the playing surface
        24 of the second table module 20 and bounces up toward the second player.
        \ The second player then strikes the ball\n14 with his or her paddle 12 such
        that it flies through the air and hits the playing surface 24 of the first
        table module 20 and bounces up toward the first player.  In similar fashion
        to conventional table tennis, the players repeat this sequence until\none
        player fails to return the ball 14 to his opponent's playing surface 24, either
        by failing to strike the ball 14 or by striking the ball 14 in such a way
        that it fails to make contact with his opponent's playing surface 24.\n<BR><BR>
        FIG. 5 is a side perspective view of the table modules 20 of FIG. 1 illustrating
        a fourth mode of play.  Though play is generally similar to that described
        with regard to FIG. 4, the top members 22 of the table modules 20 have each
        been tilted\nslightly so as to accommodate different skill levels or to make
        game play more interesting.  More particularly, the top member 22 on the right
        has been tilted away from a first player, standing at a first location 40,
        while the top member on the left has\nbeen tilted toward a second player,
        standing at a second location 41.  By tilting the top member 22 on the right
        away from the first player, it becomes more difficult for the first player
        to hit hard shots at the second player because the apparent target\narea is
        smaller in the vertical direction than normal, thereby making it more difficult
        to hit the surface with a sharply struck ball 14.  Conversely, by tilting
        the top member 22 on the left toward the second player, it becomes easier
        for the second\nplayer to hit hard shots, or perhaps any sorts of shots, at
        the first player because the apparent target area is larger in the vertical
        direction than normal, thereby making it easier to hit the surface with the
        ball 14.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 6 is a side perspective view of the elements of the
        modular table tennis game set 10 of FIG. 1 illustrating a fifth mode of play.
        \ In particular, FIG. 6 illustrates a two-person game wherein a first player,
        holding a paddle 12, stands at\nany of a plurality of locations 40 around
        a first table module 20, and a second player, also holding a paddle 12, stands
        at any of a plurality of locations 41 around a second table module 20.  The
        table modules 20 are spaced apart as in FIG. 4, but each\ntop member 22 is
        significantly angled in a manner somewhat similar to that of FIG. 2.  Unlike
        the arrangement in FIG. 2, however, each top member 22 is angled so that a
        ball 14 struck by the opposing player bounces almost straight up in the air,
        making\nit somewhat difficult to reach and strike the ball 14 to return it
        to the opponent's table surface 24.  Otherwise, game play may be similar to
        that described with regard to FIGS. 4 and 5, except that it may be desired
        to establish a rule against causing\nthe ball 14 to bounce so high as to hit
        the ceiling 50 of a room in which the game is being played.  Notably, it may
        also be necessary for each player to change locations 40,41 frequently in
        response to the greater difficulty that may be inherent in\ntrying to reach
        and successfully strike a ball 14 bouncing off an angled playing surface 24.\n<BR><BR>
        FIGS. 7A and 7B are a side perspective view and a top perspective view, respectively,
        of the elements of the modular table tennis game set 10 of FIG. 1, together
        with an additional table module 20, illustrating a sixth mode of play.  Two
        of the\ntable modules 20 are spaced apart with their top members 22 generally
        horizontal as in FIG. 4, but the third table module 20 is placed part way
        between the other modules 20 and off to the side (perhaps best shown in FIG.
        7B).  Such an arrangement may be\nused to play game variations incorporating
        elements of the game of racquetball, wherein the table surface 24 of the third
        table serves as a wall and is in play during the game.\n<BR><BR> To play,
        the first player strikes the ball 14 with the paddle 12 such that it flies
        through the air and hits the playing surface 24 of the third table module
        20, bounces and hits the playing surface 24 of the second table module 20,
        and then\nbounces up toward the second player.  The second player then strikes
        the ball 14 with his or her paddle such that it flies through the air and
        hits the playing surface 24 of the third table module 20, bounces and hits
        the playing surface 24 of the first\ntable module 20, and finally bounces
        up toward the first player.  In similar fashion to conventional table tennis,
        the players repeat this sequence until one player fails to return the ball
        14 to his opponent's playing surface 24 via the third playing\nsurface 24,
        either by failing to strike the ball 14 or by striking the ball 14 in such
        a way that it fails to make contact with his opponent's playing surface 24
        after making contact with the third playing surface 24.  In variations, players
        may or may\nnot be required to hit every shot such that the ball 14 strikes
        the third playing surface 24 before striking his opponent's playing surface
        24.\n<BR><BR> Alternatively, if an additional table module 20 is not available,
        or if the player wishes to enjoy a different playing experience, other vertical
        surfaces, such as an interior wall in a house or the like, may be substituted
        for the third table\nmodule 20.\n<BR><BR> FIGS. 8A and 8B are a side perspective
        view and a top perspective view, respectively, of the elements of the modular
        table tennis game set 10 of FIG. 1, together with two additional table modules
        20, illustrating a seventh mode of play.  More\nparticularly, two pairs of
        table modules 20 are arranged to face each other, with the table modules 20
        in each pair aligned with each other.  The table modules 20 in each pair may
        be placed right next to each other or spaced apart by some distance.  Four\nplayers
        are involved, with each player standing at a location 40,41,42,43 behind or
        beside a respective table module 20, facing the opposite table modules 20
        and the players standing therebehind.  Game play is similar to that described
        with respect to\nFIG. 4, except that doubles table tennis rules may be incorporated
        if desired.  In other words, the players in locations 40,42 beside the left
        pair of table modules 20 play as partners, and attempt, when striking the
        ball 14, to cause the ball 14 to hit\neither of the table modules 20 of the
        right pair, and vice versa.  In variations, either player in a partnership
        may strike the ball 14 regardless of whether the ball 14 hits their respective
        table module 20, or may be required to strike the ball 14 only\nwhen it hits
        their own table module 20.  In other variations, the players in one partnership
        may each attempt to hit either table module 20 of the other partnership, or
        may be required to alternate between table modules 20 of the other partnership.\n<BR><BR>
        Any of the variations described herein may be incorporated into the arrangement
        of FIGS. 8A and 8B.  More particularly, the top members 22 of one or more
        (but not necessarily all) of the table modules 20 may be tilted to create
        a different game\nplay experience, to accommodate different skill levels,
        or both.  Additional table modules 20 may be oriented vertically to play a
        game incorporating elements of racquetball, or if additional table modules
        20 are not available, or if the players wish to\nenjoy a still-different playing
        experience, other vertical surfaces, such as an interior wall in a house or
        the like, may be substituted for such additional table modules 20.\n<BR><BR>
        FIG. 9 is a top perspective view of the elements of the modular table tennis
        game set 10 of FIG. 1, together with two additional table modules 20, illustrating
        an eighth mode of play.  More particularly, the four table modules 20 of FIGS.
        8A and\n8B are rearranged so as to be at generally right angles to each other.
        \ In this arrangement, players can play as partners or as individuals.  In
        at least one variation, a game incorporating elements of the traditional game
        of four-square may be played\nusing this arrangement.  Once again, any of
        the variations described herein may be incorporated into the arrangement of
        FIG. 9.  More particularly, the top members 22 of one or more (but not necessarily
        all) of the table modules 20 may be tilted to\ncreate a different game play
        experience, to accommodate different skill levels, or both.  Additional table
        modules 20 may be oriented vertically to play a game incorporating elements
        of racquetball, or if additional table modules 20 are not available, or\nif
        the players wish to enjoy a still-different playing experience, other vertical
        surfaces, such as an interior wall in a house or the like, may be substituted
        for such additional table modules 20.\n<BR><BR> Still other variations are
        likewise contemplated, including the arrangement of top members 22 at both
        a tilt angle as well as a side-to-side angle.  Each mounting assembly 32 may
        be capable of adjustment around each of two or more axes to\nprovide such
        functionality.  Each tripod 26 is preferably also height-adjustable such that
        the level of the top member 22 may be raised and lowered to accommodate players
        of different heights or skill levels, to provide a different game playing\nexperience,
        or even to allow players to sit down while playing, either on a conventional
        chair or stool or in a wheelchair.  Of particular note, it may be possible
        for adults to play against children in a competitive environment by adjusting
        the top\nmember height, tilt angle, or side to side angle, or to adjust other
        factors, in order to give each player a fair chance of winning a game.\n<BR><BR>
        In a further feature, each table module 20 may be portable, wherein straps
        or a carry bag could be used to facilitate transport from one location to
        another.  Such a feature may make it possible for friends to gather to combine
        their respective\ntable modules 20 to open up new game play possibilities,
        including at least some of those described herein.  Portability may also facilitate
        outdoor play, wherein one or more of the games and game arrangements described
        and illustrated herein may be\nplayed outdoors, particularly if a heavier
        ball is available.\n<BR><BR> FIGS. 10A and 10B are perspective views of a
        table module 120 of a modular table tennis game set in accordance with a second
        preferred embodiment of the present invention.  The table module 120 includes
        a top member 122, preferably having a\nplaying surface 124 of a composition
        conventionally used for table tennis playing surfaces (though in the illustrated
        embodiment the top member 122 may be constructed from a piece of plywood and
        the playing surface 124 may merely be a top surface of the\nplywood), supported
        by a three-leg support system 126.  More particularly, the three-leg support
        system 126 includes three adjustable legs 128, each of which may be of generally
        conventional adjustable- or extendable-leg construction, arranged around the\nperiphery
        of the top member 122 to provide stable support therefor.  By extending or
        retracting each individual leg 128, the top member 122 may be tilted as desired.
        \ More particularly, by adjusting the length of a first leg 131 relative to
        the other two\nlegs 133, the portion of the top member 122 supported by the
        first leg 131 is raised or lowered accordingly relative to the other portions
        of the top member 122.  In this way, the top member 122 may be adjusted, for
        example, from a generally horizontal\norientation as shown in FIG. 10A to
        a tilted orientation as shown in FIG. 10B.\n<BR><BR> In some embodiments,
        each leg 128 may be attached to the top member 122 at a fixed angle, and the
        top member 122 is tilted without changing the angle between the top member
        122 and any of the legs 128.  In other embodiments, each leg 128 is\nconnected
        to the top member 122 via an adjustable mounting assembly 132 that includes
        a first part fixed to the top of the leg and a second part fixed to the top
        member 122, with the second part being rotatable, relative to the first part,
        about at least\none axis of rotation.  The amount of rotation necessary may
        not be particularly great, but permits the top member 122 to be placed in
        a tilted orientation without unbalancing the module 120.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 11
        is a perspective view of a table module 220 of a modular table tennis game
        set in accordance with a third preferred embodiment of the present invention.
        \ The table module 220 includes a top member 222, preferably having a playing
        surface\n224 of a composition conventionally used for table tennis playing
        surfaces (though in the illustrated embodiment the top member 222 may be constructed
        from a piece of composition board, plywood or the like, and the playing surface
        224 may merely be a top\nsurface of the composition board), supported by a
        three-leg support system 226.  The top member 222 is generally wedge-shaped
        to facilitate one or more methods of play, with a front end 235 of the top
        member 222 tapering to a curved nose and a rear end\n237 having two distinct
        comers 239.  The three-leg support system 226 includes three fixed-length
        legs 228, each of which may be of generally conventional construction, arranged
        around the periphery of the top member 222 to provide stable support\ntherefor.
        \ In particular, legs of two different lengths are provided, with a shorter
        leg 231 disposed near the front end 235 of the table module 220 and two longer
        legs 233 disposed near the rear corners 239 of the module 220.\n<BR><BR> Though
        not illustrated, in at least one embodiment a wedge-shaped top member like
        the top member 222 of FIG. 11 may also be used with adjustable legs, such
        as those shown in FIG. 10, thereby providing additional variability.  Still
        further, in\nat least one embodiment a wedge-shaped top member or other top
        members may be used with legs having limited adjustability, such as, by way
        of example, legs having three positions or length settings, thereby providing
        a long, medium and short leg length\nsetting.  In one such embodiment, a first
        leg disposed at the front of a wedge-shaped top member has a high setting
        that places the front end of the top member at the same height as the rear
        end of the top member when second and third legs disposed at\nthe rear are
        placed in their lowest setting.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 12 is a perspective view of
        the elements, including three table modules 220 of the type shown in FIG.
        11, of a modular table tennis game set 210, illustrating a mode of play for
        a modular table tennis game.  The game set 210 includes three\ntable modules
        220, three paddles 12, and a ball 14.  Once again, the paddles 12 and ball
        14 may each be of the type conventionally used to play ping-pong.  In at least
        one proposed commercial embodiment, production versions of the elements shown
        in FIG.\n12 may be packaged and sold together; however, it will be apparent
        that the table modules 220 may be sold with or without the other elements,
        and likewise may be sold individually or in larger groups, all without departing
        from the scope of the present\ninvention.  For example, in one embodiment,
        three table modules 220, three paddles 12 and one or more balls 14 would be
        sold together, while in another embodiment, two table modules 220, two paddles
        12 and one or more balls 14 would be sold together with\na third table module
        220 available individually, and in still another embodiment, the paddles 12
        would be sold separately, and each table module 220 would be sold separately.\n<BR><BR>
        FIGS. 13 and 14 are a top front perspective view and a bottom front perspective
        view, respectively, of six table modules 320 of a modular table tennis game
        set 310 in accordance with a fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention.
        \ Each\ntable module 320 includes a top member 322, preferably having a playing
        surface 324 of a composition conventionally used for table tennis playing
        surfaces supported by a three-leg support system 326.  As with the table modules
        220 of FIGS. 11 and 12,\neach top member 322 is generally wedge-shaped to
        facilitate one or more methods of play, with a front end of the top member
        322 tapering to a curved nose and a rear end having two distinct comers.  The
        three-leg support system 326 includes three\nfixed-length legs 328, each of
        which may be of generally conventional construction, arranged around the periphery
        to provide stable support for the top member 322.  In particular, legs of
        two lengths are provided, with a shorter leg 331 disposed near the\nfront
        end of the table module 320 and two longer legs 333 disposed near the rear
        comers 339 of the module 320.\n<BR><BR> FIGS. 13 and 14 illustrate several
        other variations relative to the table modules 220 of FIGS. 11 and 12.  First,
        the dimensions vary, including the tilt angle (back to front) of each table
        module 320.  Further, each top member 322 is penetrated\nby an opening 321
        covered on the bottom side by a basket 323 that is supported from the underside
        of the top member 322.  The opening 321 should be considerably larger than
        the diameter of the ball 14, but the specific dimensions may be selected\naccording
        to the degree of difficulty desired for one or methods of play.  Still further,
        each leg 328 includes a conventional latching pivot mechanism 327 to permit
        the leg 328 to be folded up against the underside of the top member 322 for
        storage or\ntransport, and further includes a foot 329, made from rubber,
        plastic or the like in conventional manner, to protect the bottom end of the
        leg 328 from damage, to prevent damage to the floor or other surface on which
        the table module 320 is supported, to\nprovide a more stable support for the
        table module 320, and the like.  In at least some embodiments, the conventional
        latching pivot mechanism 327 is an adjustable mounting assembly having a first
        part fixed to the top of the leg and a second part fixed\nto the top member
        322, with the second part being rotatable, relative to the first part, about
        at least one axis of rotation, and may be used to adjust the height of the
        top member.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 15 is a top front perspective view of six table
        modules 720 of a modular table tennis game set 710 in accordance with a fifth
        preferred embodiment of the present invention.  The modules 720 are generally
        similar to those of FIG. 13, except\nthat the top member 722 and playing surface
        724 do not include any opening.  Like the top member 322 of FIG. 13, the top
        member 722 of these modules 720 preferably includes a playing surface 324
        of a composition conventionally used for table tennis\nplaying surfaces, and
        each top member 722 is generally wedge-shaped to facilitate one or more methods
        of play, with a front end of the top member 722 tapering to a curved nose
        and a rear end having two distinct corners.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 16 is a top view
        of six table modules 420 of a modular table tennis game set 410 in accordance
        with a sixth preferred embodiment of the present invention.  Each table module
        420 is generally similar to the table modules 320 of FIGS. 13 and\n14 but
        includes striping 444,446 on the playing surface 424.  A first stripe 444
        extends around the periphery of the playing surface 424 to better visually
        define the edge of the surface 424, and a second stripe 446 extends straight
        across the body of\nthe playing surface, intersecting the opening 421 on the
        way, to provide additional interest to one or more methods of play, some of
        which are described hereinbelow.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 17 is a top front perspective
        view of elements of a modular table tennis game set 510 in accordance with
        a seventh preferred embodiment of the present invention.  As shown therein,
        each table module 520 is similar to those of FIG. 16 but\nfurther includes
        a scoring device 548 near the rear end of a top member 522.  Such a device
        disposed in this location makes it easy for a player to keep track of his
        or her score during a game played according to one or more methods, some of
        which are\ndisclosed herein.  The modular table tennis game set 510 of FIG.
        17 also includes a center mat 550, which is provided to provide users with
        an indication of location and alignment of the table modules 520 relative
        to each other.  More particularly, radii\n552 extending from the center of
        the mat 550 show the alignment for up to twelve table modules 520 and can
        be used to define the spacing between modules 520 according to the number
        of modules 520 to be utilized.  Furthermore, the periphery of the mat 550\nprovides
        one indication of the desired disposition of the front end of each table module
        520; additional markings may be provided, each at a uniform distance from
        the center of the mat 550, for alternative dispositions.  Such a mat 550 may
        likewise be\nincorporated into one or more of the other embodiments described
        and illustrated herein.\n<BR><BR> One or more methods of play are next described
        in view of the foregoing description and the illustrations accompanying them.
        \ Some of the descriptions of play make reference to FIGS. 18-20, which show
        various arrangements of table modules 620 of\na modular table tennis game
        set 610 in accordance with a eighth preferred embodiment of the present invention.\n<BR><BR>First
        Method of Play\n<BR><BR> In a method of play in accordance with a first preferred
        method of the present invention, two table modules 20,120,220,320,420,520,620,720
        each in accordance with one or more of the preferred embodiments of the present
        invention, are arranged to\nface each other, but separated by a desired distance.
        \ Such a distance may be established by official rules, provided in conjunction
        with the provision of the table modules, or by agreement between the players.
        \ Each player has his or her own table\nmodule 20,120,220,320,420,520,620,720
        and paddle 12.  No matter how many players participate in a given game or
        match, all table modules 20,120,220,320,420,520,620,720 are equally spaced
        apart from each other in a circular formation.  In at least one\nembodiment,
        each player should position the nose, or narrower end, of his or her table
        module 20,120,220,320,420,520,620,720 a distance of 2.25 feet away from the
        circle's center.  In at least one embodiment, a mat, such as the mat 550 of
        FIG. 17, is\nused to define the distance and proper location.  The nose should
        also face the inside of the circle.  During play, each player stands generally
        behind or beside his own table module 20,120,220,320,420,520,620,720 on the
        outside of the circle.\n<BR><BR> A match may include one or more games.  During
        each game, one player puts the ball 14 in play by serving it to the table
        module 20,120,220,320,420,520,620,720 of another player.  An exemplary serve
        is schematically illustrated in FIG. 18, which\nis a top front perspective
        view of six table modules 620 of the modular table tennis game set 610.  The
        first server may be chosen by any desired method.  If provided, the center
        stripe 444 on the playing surface 424 of each table module\n20,120,220,320,420,520,620
        is defined as the service line.  In at least one method of game play, players
        must always hit the ball 14 so that it lands above the service line 444 (in
        the area closest to the opposing player) of the opponent's playing\nsurface
        424.  If the server misses the playing surface 424 entirely, he loses a point.
        \ If he hits the ball 14 and it lands below the service line 444 on the opponent's
        playing surface 424, he receives one more chance to successfully serve the
        ball 14\nabove the line 444.\n<BR><BR> In at least one method of game play,
        each player announces how many points he has before each new serve, starting
        with the player who is serving.  In at least one method of game play, if five
        or more players are participating in a game, the\nserver is not permitted
        to serve to the players directly to his right or left, but if four or fewer
        players are participating, then the server may serve to anyone in the game.\n<BR><BR>
        After the ball 14 is served, the receiving player attempts to strike the ball
        14 in such a way as to cause it to land on another player's playing surface
        424.  In at least one method of game play, if the ball 14 ricochets off the
        edge of the\nplaying surface 424 and flies upward and the receiving player
        misses the ball 14, the server gains a point; if the ball 14 flies downward
        (toward the floor, the ground or the like) and the receiving player misses
        it, it is deemed to be a \"fault\" and the\nserver must deduct one point from
        his total score.  In at least one method of game play, other than during the
        serve, there is no limitation as to which of the various opponent playing
        surfaces 424 the striking player aims for or on which opponent's\nplaying
        surface 424 the ball 14 actually lands.  However, in at least one method of
        game play, an interference rule is established such that a player cannot strike
        the ball 14 before it makes contact with his playing surface 424; it must
        bounce once\nbefore it is returned; it cannot double bounce; it must be returned
        by the player to whom the playing surface 424 belongs; and a player may not
        strike the ball 14 if it has already bounced on another player's playing surface
        424.  The penalty for\ninterference is preferably set as the deduction of
        one point from the score of the player who violates the rule; scoring is further
        described below.\n<BR><BR> In at least one method of game play, the participating
        players take turns serving, with each turn defined as three serves (not including
        second chance serves, described above).  When the server's turn is over, he
        or she passes the ball 14 to the\nplayer on his or her left (clockwise) for
        the next turn to serve.\n<BR><BR> With regard to scoring, each player is responsible
        for keeping track of his own points.  All players begin with a predetermined
        number of points, with twelve points being preferred in at least one method
        of game play, and points are deducted\nfrom individual players' scores as
        they make errors.  Players are eliminated from the game when their score drops
        to zero.  The last player in the game wins.  In at least one method of game
        play, a player must deduct a point from his total score when he\ndoes not
        successfully serve or return the ball (i.e. make contact with an opposing
        player's playing surface 24,124,224,324,424,525,624,724), when he scores on
        his own goal (defined as the combination of an opening and basket such as
        the opening 321 and\nbasket 323 of FIG. 13) when attempting to serve, or when
        the ball hits the edge of his own opening during play and deflects off the
        playing surface 24,124,224,324,424,525,624,724.  Furthermore, in at least
        one method of game play, a player must deduct\nthree points when his goal
        is scored upon, wherein scoring on a goal is defined the ball 14 being struck,
        by any player, such that it passes completely through the opening in the player's
        top member and lands in his basket (for example, the opening 321,\ntop member
        322 and basket 323 shown in FIG. 13) without bouncing back out.\n<BR><BR>
        FIG. 19 is a top front perspective view of the six table modules 620 of FIG.
        18 with one of the modules 620 being removed in accordance with a mode of
        play.  In at least one method of game play, as players are eliminated, their
        table module\n20,120,220,320,420,520,620,720 is removed but the other modules
        20,120,220,320,420,520,620,720 remain in their location.  FIG. 20 is a top
        front perspective view of the five remaining table modules 620 of FIG. 19
        (i.e., after one of the table modules 620\nhas been removed), and FIG. 21
        is a top front perspective view of three remaining table modules 620 from
        FIG. 20, illustrating an arrangement of the table modules 620 after three
        players have been eliminated and their modules 620 removed.  In at least\nanother
        method of game play, as players are eliminated, their table module 20,120,220,320,420,520,620,720
        are removed and the remaining players must rearrange their table modules 20,120,220,320,420,520,620,720
        to maintain the circular formation and make\nsure they are equally spaced
        from each other.\n<BR><BR>Second Method of Play\n<BR><BR> In a method of play
        in accordance with a second preferred method of the present invention, all
        of the rules and variations described above are used except for one further
        variation: scoring on an opponent's goal automatically eliminates the\nopponent
        (not the scorer) from the game.\n<BR><BR>Third Method of Play\n<BR><BR> In
        a method of play in accordance with a third preferred method of the present
        invention, only two players are involved and only two table modules 20,120,220,320,420,520,620,720
        are utilized.  A different set of rules are incorporated for a\n\"rally\"
        form of the game.  To play, the two players' table modules 20,120,220,320,420,520,620,720
        are arranged directly across from each other, approximately 4.5 feet apart.
        \ A mat, such as the mat 550 of FIG. 17, may be used to establish the proper\ndistance.
        \ The object of the game is to be the first to score three points.  In other
        words, unlike the first and second methods of play described above, each player
        does not begin with twelve points and subtract from their score for errors
        committed. \nIn the third method of play, a player can only score by hitting
        the ball 14 into the opposing player's goal.  Additionally, the server does
        not receive three automatic chances to serve the ball 14, but must earn his
        right to serve.\n<BR><BR> Play begins by choosing one player to begin serving.
        \ The server must hit the ball 14 above the service line 444 of the opposing
        player's playing surface for the serve to count.  The server has two attempts
        to successfully serve the ball before\nlosing his turn.  The players then
        alternate shots in somewhat similar manner to traditional ping-pong, but a
        player's failure to return the ball 14 successfully does not score a point
        but instead merely gives his opponent the right to serve, which in at\nleast
        some methods of game play is a significant advantage.\n<BR><BR> In at least
        one method of game play, hitting the ball 14 into the opposing player's goal
        not only scores a point but gives the player the right to serve.  In at least
        one method of game play, if the server hits the ball 14 such that it hits
        the\nedge of the opponent's goal and then bounces off the playing surface
        424, he may serve again.  In at least one method of game play, serving the
        ball 14 directly into the opponent's goal counts as an automatic point.\n<BR><BR>Fourth
        Method of Play\n<BR><BR> In a fourth method of play in accordance with a fourth
        preferred method of the present invention, one of the first two methods is
        modified by switching to rally play, as described with regard to the third
        method of play, when only two players\nremain in the game.  FIG. 22 is a top
        front perspective view of two remaining table modules 620 from FIG. 21, wherein
        the two remaining players use rally play to determine a final winner.  All
        rules of either the first or second method of play apply\nbefore that time,
        and all rules of the third method of play apply during rally play.\n<BR><BR>
