        \      <p> A frequency modulated (coherent) laser detection and ranging system\n
        \    includes a read-out integrated circuit formed with a two-dimensional\n
        \    array of detector elements each including a photosensitive region\n     receiving
        both return light reflected from a target and light from a\n     local oscillator,
        and local processing circuitry sampling the output of\n     the photosensitive
        region four times during each sample period clock\n     cycle to obtain quadrature
        components. A data bus coupled to one or more\n     outputs of each of the
        detector elements receives the quadrature\n     components from each of the
        detector elements for each sample period and\n     serializes the received
        quadrature components. A processor coupled to the\n     data bus receives
        the serialized quadrature components and determines an\n     amplitude and
        a phase for at least one interfering frequency\n     corresponding to interference
        between the return light and the local\n     oscillator light using the quadrature
        components.\n</p>\n       <HR>\n<TABLE width=\"100%\"> <TR> <TH scope=\"row\"

        The present disclosure is directed in general to laser detection and ranging,
        and, more particularly, to frequency-modulated laser detection and ranging.\n<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
        OF THE DISCLOSURE\n<BR><BR> Current approaches for obtaining the largest format
        detector arrays for frequency-modulated laser detection and ranging have involved
        increasing the number, size and/or complexity of amplifiers, analog-to-digital
        converters, and memories\nassociated with the pixels of an array of high-bandwidth
        detectors.  High digitization rates and the resulting large volumes of data
        that must be sent to a processor to compute the amplitude and phase of the
        return signal have limited array sizes and\neffectively precluded real-time
        operation.\n<BR><BR> There is, therefore, a need in the art for improved capture
        and handling of data employed for coherent laser detection and ranging.\n<BR><BR>SUMMARY
        OF THE DISCLOSURE\n<BR><BR> A frequency modulated (coherent) laser detection
        and ranging system includes a read-out integrated circuit formed with a two-dimensional
        array of detector elements each including a photosensitive region receiving
        both return light reflected from\na target and light from a local oscillator,
        and local processing circuitry sampling the output of the photosensitive region
        four times during each sample period clock cycle to obtain quadrature components.
        \ A data bus coupled to one or more outputs of\neach of the detector elements
        receives the quadrature components from each of the detector elements for
        each sample period and serializes the received quadrature components.  A processor
        coupled to the data bus receives the serialized quadrature\ncomponents and
        determines an amplitude and a phase for at least one interfering frequency
        corresponding to interference between the return light and the local oscillator
        light using the quadrature components.\n<BR><BR> Although specific advantages
        have been enumerated above, various embodiments may include some, none, or
        all of the enumerated advantages.  Additionally, other technical advantages
        may become readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art\nafter review
        of the following figures and description. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE
        DRAWINGS\n<BR><BR> For a more complete understanding of the present disclosure
        and its advantages, reference is now made to the following description taken
        in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals
        represent like parts:\n<BR><BR> FIGS. 1A, 1B and 1C diagrammatically illustrate
        operation of, respectively, a pulsed LADAR system typically employed for long-range
        3D imaging, an AM LADAR system typically used for shorter range applications,
        and an FM LADAR system based on\nfrequency modulation of a coherent laser
        source;\n<BR><BR> FIGS. 2 and 2A illustrate data processing associated with
        use of an FM LADAR system using GmAPD receivers in the detector array;\n<BR><BR>
        FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating synchronous coherent optical detection
        for FM LADAR in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure; and\n<BR><BR>
        FIG. 4 illustrates use of synchronous coherent optical detection for FM LADAR
        for real-time interferometry in accordance with embodiments of the present
        disclosure.\n<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION\n<BR><BR> It should be understood
        at the outset that, although exemplary embodiments are illustrated in the
        figures and described below, the principles of the present disclosure may
        be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or\nnot.
        \ The present disclosure should in no way be limited to the exemplary implementations
        and techniques illustrated in the drawings and described below.  Additionally,
        unless otherwise specifically noted, articles depicted in the drawings are
        not\nnecessarily drawn to scale.\n<BR><BR> Laser detection and ranging (LADAR)
        systems are the optical analog of radar systems, in which the target is illuminated
        with light from a laser source and the return is detected with an optical
        detector.  The resulting signal from the optical\ndetector is processed to
        determine information about the target, such as range or velocity.\n<BR><BR>
        LADAR applications are driven to some extent by component technologies.  Laser
        sources include both diode lasers that are generally compact, efficient, and
        low-cost but only low power, and eye-safe lasers that operate at wavelengths
        greater than\nabout 1.5 microns (.mu.m) and enable long-range, free-space
        LADAR.  Detectors are often array detectors, to reduce the requirement for
        beam scanning.  Processors, because processing of LADAR data can be computationally
        intensive, must typically enable\nhigh-speed--and often real-time--LADAR imaging.\n<BR><BR>
        Two-dimensional arrays of coherent detectors are required for many advanced
        coherent laser detection and ranging (LADAR) systems.  A conventional approach
        is to use an array of discrete high-bandwidth detectors each having an amplifier,\nanalog-to-digital
        (A/D) converter and memory.  The resulting large volume of data is then sent
        to a processor to compute the amplitude and phase of the return signal.  The
        high digitization rates and large volumes of resulting data have limited array\nsizes
        to a small number of pixels (on the order of 10s of pixels).  There is also
        typically a large time interval required to process the data so that real-time
        operation is not achieved.\n<BR><BR> LADAR systems may generally be grouped
        into three main categories: pulsed LADAR, in which the illuminating laser
        is pulsed and the detector records time-of-flight; amplitude modulated (AM)
        LADAR, in which the amplitude of the illuminating beam\nis sinusoidally modulated
        and the detector records phase of return amplitude modulation; and frequency
        modulated (FM) LADAR, in which the frequency and/or phase of the laser illumination
        is modulated, and the detector records the relative optical phase\nof the
        return signal.  (Additionally, some LADAR systems use the parallax effect,
        which is not considered in this disclosure.) All three categories of LADAR
        systems are used in various application-dependent environments, typically
        with use of pulsed\nLADAR for long range mapping, AM modulated LADAR for short
        range three dimensional (3D) imaging, and FM modulated LADAR for interferometry,
        frequency domain optical coherence tomography, and synthetic aperture imaging.\n<BR><BR>
        FIG. 1A diagrammatically illustrates operation of a pulsed LADAR system 100
        typically employed for long-range 3D imaging.  A laser source 101 emits pulsed
        light 102 illuminating a distant target 103.  The laser 101 is ideally an
        eye-safe, high\npulse repetition frequency (PRF) emitting pulses on the order
        of 1 nanosecond (ns) duration, and high pulse energy device enabling long
        range, large field-of-view operation by the system 100.  A return part 104
        of the light 102 reflecting off the target\n103 and reaching an imaging telescope
        105 is focused by the imaging telescope 105 onto a two dimensional (2D) detector
        array 106 comprising M.times.N pixels.  The detector array 106 records return
        time (time-of-flight) on a per-pixel basis, with the\noutput of the detector
        array 106 processed by a processor (not shown separately in FIG. 1A) capable
        of handling high data and throughput rates to determine relative timing of
        return signals at different pixels and produce a 3D image.  Implementing a\ndetector
        array with sufficient timing resolution is a challenging design issue for
        this type of system.  The detector array 106 should preferably comprise detector
        pixels that incorporate high-speed detection and local processing, to achieve
        fine\ntiming-resolution detection and reduce the volume of data sent from
        the detector array to the processor.  Some imaging detector arrays convert
        optical intensity into a serialized (raster scanned) analog signal, with an
        analog-to-digital (A/D) converter\nwith memory (e.g., a frame-grabber) used
        to capture the data before transferring the data to a processor.  2D detectors
        generally incorporate digital processing into each pixel and the associated
        detector readout circuit, which is enabled by modern,\nfine-detail integrated
        circuit fabrication processes and which forms a digital readout integrated
        circuit (ROIC).  Applications of digital ROIC technology are especially useful
        for improving data quality or reducing the volume of data.  Advanced infrared\n(IR)
        detectors use digital ROICs with A/D conversion incorporated into the pixels
        to enhance dynamic range.  LADAR systems use digital ROICs for fine resolution
        timing of return signals, to determine the temporal location of peak return
        rather than\ndigitizing the entire temporal signal.\n<BR><BR> Another aspect
        of pulsed LADAR systems is that for long-range operation, high-sensitivity
        detector elements such as avalanche photo diodes (APDs) are required.  In
        this regime, the photonic nature of the light must be considered, such that
        APDs\nare adjusted to operate in high-gain, Geiger-mode (GmAPDs).  The analog
        signal from a GmAPD is series of temporal pulses caused by one or more of:
        photo-events from the return signal (shot-noise); spontaneous photo-events
        from dark noise (dark counts);\nphoto-events from background light (background
        counts); and photo-events triggered by other events (ghosts).  There can also
        be intra-pixel cross talk within an array of GmAPDs.  Nonetheless, an array
        of GmAPDs with a digital ROIC is naturally\nwell-suited for pulsed LADAR,
        since a GmAPD array records only time-stamps corresponding to sparse photo-events
        rather than digitizing temporal intensity signal and high PRF lasers allow
        averaging over multiple pulses to reduce impact of noise.  In the\nphoton-limited
        regime, the photo-sensitive detector is typically a GmAPD array with an ROIC
        that records arrival times for photo-events.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 1B diagrammatically
        illustrates operation of an AM LADAR system 110 typically used for shorter
        range applications.  The laser source 111 in this implementation provides
        AM modulated light 112.  The relative phase of the return signal 114\nfocused
        by imaging telescope 115 on detector array 116 provides a relative 3D range
        over the target 113.  A typical modulation frequency for the light 112 is
        on the order of 10s of mega-Hertz (MHz)(e.g., 30 MHz, which results in an
        ambiguity interval of\n5 meters).  AM LADAR systems are often configured as
        a scanning system, but more recent implementations use a detector array.  For
        detector arrays, every pixel should be capable of independently determining
        the distance to the object based on light\nreceived at that pixel, in effect
        operating as a massively parallel laser illuminated detection and ranging
        (LIDAR) on a single integrated circuit.  Each pixel should allow accurate
        measurement of the arrival time of the collected photons in order to be\nsubstantially
        immune to detector array surface defects that might otherwise adversely affect
        time of flight ranging.  Single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) based GmAPD
        pixels in the detector array enable such accurate measurement.  SPAD devices
        detect the\nincoming sinusoidally modulated light intensity as series of photo-events
        using a high speed clock cycled through four states (quadrature detection).
        \ Photo-events that occur during these separate clock states are accumulated
        for use in a detection\nprocess that utilizes a synchronous clock to determine
        a phase of the return signal based on the accumulated photo-events corresponding
        to the four clock states.  The gaming and machine vision industries in particular
        have driven development of\nsophisticated AM LADAR detectors with photon-counting
        based synchronous detection, measurement of modulation quadrature values performed
        at the pixel level, and fabrication based on low cost complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
        (CMOS) processes.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 1C diagrammatically illustrates operation
        of an FM LADAR system 120 based on frequency modulation of a coherent laser
        source.  The laser source in this implementation includes a master oscillator
        (MO) 121a, a frequency modulator (FM) 121b,\nand an amplifier (AMP) 121c producing
        the output 122 illuminating the target 123, and a second frequency modulator
        121d receiving a signal from the master oscillator 121a together with a local
        oscillator (LO) 121e producing an output 127 illuminating the\ndetector array
        126.  The target 123 is illuminated with coherent light 122 that originates
        from the master oscillator 121a and passes through the frequency modulator
        121b and amplifier 121c.  The return light 124 focused on the detector array
        126 by the\nimaging telescope 125 interferes with light 127 from the local
        oscillator 121e, a frequency modulated beam derived from the master oscillator
        121a.  The amplitude and phase of the return signal 124 provide information
        about the target 123.  The detector\npixels detect a sinusoidally modulated
        interference signal--that is, the signal incident on the pixels results from
        coherent interference of the return beam 124 and the local oscillator beam
        127.  For the simple case of a frequency offset between the\nreturn and local
        oscillator beams, the resulting signal intensity detected by the pixels is:\n<BR><BR>
        .function..times..times..times..function..times..pi..times..times..PHI.  ##EQU00001##
        where I(t) is the intensity of the signal received by a pixel within the detector
        array, I.sub.s is the intensity of the return light 124, I.sub.LO is the\nintensity
        of the local oscillator light 127, f is the interfering frequency, and .PHI.
        \ is a phase shift between the return light 124 and the local oscillator light
        127 at the interfering frequency f. A feature of FM detection is that the
        strength of the\nmodulated signal is proportional to {square root over (I.sub.s)}
        {square root over (I.sub.LO)}, such that the signal is boosted by the local
        oscillator power.  In addition to being useful for long range detection, FM
        systems are also employed in\ninterferometry.\n<BR><BR> FIGS. 2 and 2A illustrate
        data processing 200 associated with use of an FM LADAR system using GmAPD
        receivers in the detector array.  An intensity signal 201, derived from interfering
        return and local oscillator light signals 202, corresponds to\nphoto-events
        203.  Processing of the photo-event sequence 204 yields target information,
        including values 205 such as those illustrated in the figure.  To avoid saturation
        of the GmAPD detector, the local oscillator level is reduced.  The signal\nintensity
        detected is:\n<BR><BR> .function..times..eta..times..times..times..function..times..pi..times..t-
        imes..PHI.  ##EQU00002## where N.sub.s is the number of signal photo-events,
        N.sub.LO is the number of local oscillator photo-events, N.sub.DCR is the
        number of dark\ncounts, and .eta..sub.HET is heterodyne detection efficiency.
        \ A typical approach to implementing FM LADAR with GmAPD detector arrays has
        been to record a temporal sequence of photo-events and depicted in FIG. 2,
        then process the recorded events to\ncompute a Fourier transform resulting
        in a frequency spectrum mapping of the events as illustrated in FIG. 2A to
        determine f and .PHI..\n<BR><BR> FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating synchronous
        coherent optical detection for FM LADAR in accordance with embodiments of
        the present disclosure.  The optical detector 300 is employed as the detector
        array 126 in the system depicted in FIG.\n1C.  The optical detector 300 is
        formed by a two-dimensional M.times.N array of pixels.  The optical detector
        300 is a large format array having more than on the order of ten pixels in
        each direction and preferably having on the order of hundreds of\npixels or
        more in each direction (e.g., a 512.times.512 or larger array).  Each pixel
        within the optical detector 300 has a photosensitive material 301 receiving
        the sinusoidal return comprising return light and coherently interfering local
        oscillator\nlight as described above in connection with FIGS. 1C and 2.  The
        photosensitive material 301 for each pixel produces an analog output 303 received
        by a local processing circuit 304 for the respective pixel.  Each local processing
        circuit 304 receives a\nlocal clock signal 305 and outputs four quadrature
        value signals 306 representing sampling of the analog output 303 at intervals
        during a single sample period.  The local clock signal 305 is received from,
        and the quadrature signals 306 are provided to,\na data bus 307 that operates
        under the control of one or more timing/control signals 308 and that outputs
        serialized digital representations of the quadrature signals 306 on a signal
        line 309 to a processor or computer 310.  Processor/computer 310 (or at\nleast
        portions thereof) may be formed on the same integrated circuit chip and/or
        packaged within the same integrated circuit package as the remainder of optical
        detector 300.  Within the processor/computer 310, each of the quadrature signals
        is\nseparately processed in the manner described above in connection with
        FIGS. 2 and 2A.  The detector 300 thus applies ROIC technology to coherent
        detection, computing quadrature components Q.sub.0, Q.sub.1, Q.sub.2, Q.sub.3
        of a single interfering\nfrequency (IF) component or optionally a small number
        of IF components.  The quadrature components--and therefore the amplitude
        and phase--of the IF are computed at the sensor frame rate, allowing detection
        to be performed on a large format 2D detector.\n<BR><BR> It should be noted
        that, although quadrature components are described in the exemplary embodiment
        above, the number of samples captured during a clock sample period may be
        less (e.g., three) or more (e.g., five or greater) than four.  The number\nof
        parallel signal lines 306 from the local processing circuit 304 for each pixel
        and the data bus 307 would naturally match the number of samples captured
        at intervals during a single sample period.\n<BR><BR> Applications of synchronous
        coherent optical detection for FM LADAR include real-time interferometry,
        velocity measurement, vibration sensing, two-wavelength 3D imaging, and wavefront
        sensing for atmospheric compensation.  Synchronous coherent\noptical detection
        for FM LADAR enables 3D imaging at much longer ranges than AM systems, and
        is applicable to the gaming industry and virtual reality systems.\n<BR><BR>
        FIG. 4 illustrates use of synchronous coherent optical detection for FM LADAR
        for real-time interferometry in accordance with embodiments of the present
        disclosure.  For real-time interferometry, the phase data from coherent synchronous\ndetection
        is equivalent to an interferogram, and quadrature detection is equivalent
        to phase-shifting interferometry.  In the real-time interferometry system
        400, an FM laser source 401 emits illumination 402 that is split by a beam
        splitter 403 such\nthat a portion is received by a frequency modulator 404,
        which produces frequency modulated illumination 405 based on the emitted light
        402.  A remainder of the emitted light 402 passes through a lens 406 onto
        a half-silvered mirror 407 that reflects\npart of the light onto a test surface
        408.  Portions of the light reflecting off test surface 408 passes through
        mirror 407 and through lens 409 to impinge upon an optical detector 410 structured
        as depicted in FIG. 3.  The reference light 405 passes\nthrough a lens 411
        and reflects off half-silvered mirror 407, and then also passes through lens
        409 to impinge upon the optical detector 410.  In this implementation, the
        light reflected off test surface 408 and passing through mirror 407 to reach
        the\noptical detector 410 corresponds to the return light 124 reflected off
        the target 123 in FIG. 1C, while the reference light 405 reflected off the
        mirror 407 to reach the optical detector 410 corresponds to the local oscillator
        light 127.  In this\napplication, the high frame-rate capability of the optical
        detector 410 allows analysis of components in dynamic conditions.  The phase
        difference between interferograms at different times allows determination
        of displacement, and therefore velocity\nmeasurement (since displacement per
        unit time is velocity), and measurement of velocity periodicity allows determination
        of vibration.  The difference between phase measurements at two wavelengths
        (which may be recorded sequentially or, for an advanced\nsynchronous detector,
        on two interference frequencies) provides 3D imaging.\n<BR><BR> For turbulence
        compensation, coherent synchronous detection also allows real-time recording
        of complex-values images, to which a sharpness algorithm may be used to determine
        atmospheric phase error to produce a turbulence-corrected image or to\ndetermine
        the correction to be applied to pre-compensate a high-energy laser.  Additional
        details of turbulence correction may be found in J. C. Marron, et al., \"Atmospheric
        turbulence correction using digital holographic detection: experimental\nresults,\"
        Optics Express, 17, 11638-11651 (2009).\n<BR><BR> For digital holography,
        conventional detector arrays employ long pulse illumination with zero interference
        frequency.  The static fringe pattern recorded represents coherent information
        recorded on a spatial carrier frequency.  Synchronous\ncoherent detection
        can operate at Q=1 rather than Q=2.\n<BR><BR> Modifications, additions, or

        frameworks, a first framework and a second\n     framework. The first framework
        is disposed in a first plane and comprises\n     at least two parallel, vertically-spaced
        apart, laterally extending\n     rails. There are three attachments supported
        by the first framework for\n     attachment to the three-point hitch. The
        second framework is slidable\n     generally in the plane of the first framework
        and is mounted on the rails\n     to slide laterally along the rails. At least
        two connectors are supported\n     by the slidable second framework for connecting
        the second framework to\n     an implement that can be pulled or pushed by
        the mobile machinery. A\n     driver is connected to the first framework and
        connected to the second\n     framework for driving the second framework laterally
        back and forth along\n     the rails of the first framework.\n</P>\n   <HR>\n<TABLE

        No. 62/496,424 titled \"Laterally\n     adjustable three-point hitch implement
        apparatus,\" filed Oct. 18, 2016,\n     the contents of which are incorporated
        herein by reference in their\n     entirety.\n       <BR><BR>BACKGROUND\n<BR><BR>[0002]
        Mobile machinery such as agricultural tractors, bulldozers, track\n     tractors,
        skip loaders, all-terrain vehicles and earth grading tractors,\n     generally
        referred to as a \"tractor,\" typically are provided with a\n     suitable
        power plant, a source of fluid under pressure and or a source of\n     electric
        current. The fluid pressure source includes suitable valve\n     control means.
        The tractors typically include an implement mounting\n     system known as
        a three-point hitch. The three-point hitch includes a\n     pair of opposed
        spaced apart lateral bottom-link arms located at the rear\n     of the tractor
        body or frame rotatably connected to the tractor with ball\n     joints which
        are affixed to the frame or body of the tractor at a\n     selected distance
        of typically 12 to 30 inches above the ground and\n     extend on each side
        of a center draw bar. The free distal ends of the\n     arms typically include
        a ball rotatable in a socket with an axial hole\n     extending there through.\n<BR><BR>[0003]
        A third arm, called a top-link arm, is also rotatably connected\n     with
        a ball joint to the tractor frame at a point about 30 to 60 inches\n     above
        ground and centered above the bottom-link arms. The free distal end\n     of
        the top-link arm is fitted with a rotatable ball with an axial hole\n     extending
        there through for connecting to a center point on an implement\n     in alignment
        with studs. Free ends of the two bottom-link arms and the\n     top-link arm
        provide three-points of attachment to implements and\n     therefore is referred
        to as a three-point hitch. The length of top-link\n     arm is generally adjustable
        by means of a built in turn-buckle assembly.\n     This provides for manual
        leveling of the attached implement. The top-link\n     arm turn buckle assembly
        can be replaced with a hydraulic cylinder for\n     quick controlled manual
        or automated adjustments of the length of the\n     top-link arm resulting
        in adjustments of the attached three-point\n     implement.\n<BR><BR>[0004]
        The bottom-link arms are connected to a lift-link arm to provide a\n     means
        for lifting such as a suitable power lift mechanism, for example\n     one
        or more hydraulic cylinders. This provides the capability to raise\n     and
        lower the two bottom-link arms and thus the implement which is\n     connected
        to the three-point hitch. Because the free ends of all three\n     arms are
        connected to the tractor with ball joint type connections, all\n     three
        arms may freely pivot to the left and the right any time the\n     three-point
        hitch has the implement raised off the ground. On older\n     tractors, an
        additional bar called a stabilizer arm is provided, if\n     desired, and
        is connected to one of the first two bottom-link arms and to\n     a fixed
        point on the tractor. On newer tractors, two stabilizer arms are\n     provided,
        one for each bottom-link arm and they are also connected to a\n     fixed
        point on the tractor. The stabilizer arms allow the bottom-link\n     arms
        to still be raised and lowered by hydraulic means, but the implement\n     is
        held stable with reference to the horizontal plane, and cannot swing\n     to
        and fro as before.\n<BR><BR>[0005] The attached implement can include a transversely
        extending tool\n     bar or frame member having laterally spaced apart studs
        extending from\n     the front tractor-facing side of the implement for removable
        attachment\n     to the sockets held within the distal ends of the bottom-link
        arms. In\n     addition to the bottom-link arm attachment hardware means is
        an upper\n     attachment hardware means for the attachment of the top-link
        arm.\n<BR><BR>[0006] A three-point hitch is standard equipment on most agricultural
        and\n     earth grading tractors. The use of a three-point hitch provides
        lifting,\n     lowering and tilting mechanisms to attached agricultural implements,
        such\n     as agricultural implements. The tractor three-point hitch allows
        the\n     attached tool or implement to be raised and lowered, tilted horizontally\n
        \    and tilted vertically, all such movements and adjustments provided by\n
        \    hydraulically activated cylinders or manual crank screw devices. Front\n
        \    three-point hitches, while available, are less common than rear\n     three-point
        hitches on agricultural tractors.\n<BR><BR>[0007] The three-point hitch provides
        for a quick attachment of various\n     implements needed on a tractor. In
        addition, when the implement is in the\n     raised or lowered position, lateral
        movement of the three-point\n     bottom-link arms is freely available. To
        limit lateral movement of the\n     implement in the raised or lowered position,
        the user can add a\n     stabilizer arm comprising a longitudinal member having
        a selected\n     adjustable length attachable to a swing arm attachment point
        on the\n     tractor body or frame with the opposing end attaching to the
        same\n     implement stud as the adjacent swing arm to limit lateral movement
        of the\n     bottom-link arms. Many tractor brands are now factory supplied
        with\n     three-point hitch bottom-link stabilizer arms. Controlled lateral\n
        \    movement of an attached implement is not provided with a three-point\n
        \    hitch.\n<BR><BR>[0008] Earth-moving equipment in the construction and
        farming field has\n     rapidly changed for the better in recent years with
        the introduction of\n     Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and laser guidance
        systems. Current GPS\n     guidance systems for earth-moving and agricultural
        tractors generally are\n     designed to auto-steer the tractor. Much of the
        guidance involves\n     steering the tractor in a straight line to form a
        straight road or\n     straight row of crops. Since most agricultural and
        earth grading tractors\n     are steered by the front end of the tractor,
        the rear end mounted\n     three-point hitch attached implement may not align
        in a straight line\n     with the front steered end of the tractor. This misalignment
        would\n     normally occur while the tractor is turning 180 degrees around
        at the end\n     of the crop row and then joining onto the next crop row in
        the other\n     direction. This misalignment would also occur while the tractor
        is in the\n     middle of the crop field and the tractor veered slightly off
        line of the\n     crop straight line forcing the tractor operator to correct
        the steering\n     of the tractor. This steering correction of the tractor
        can also shift\n     the rear end of the tractor in the opposite direction
        of the steering\n     correction causing the rear three-point connected implement
        to also veer\n     off course of the straight crop row and possibly damage
        the crops while\n     cultivating the field or misalign the crops while planting.
        Lasers have\n     come into play in the earth-moving and agricultural field
        mostly by\n     controlling grade leveling implements on the tractor in an
        up and down\n     motion for achieving a level or sloped grade.\n<BR><BR>[0009]
        Conventional laterally moving implement toolbars pivot on four\n     parallel
        supporting arms extending out from the front of the supporting\n     frame.
        Short sized supporting arms provide limited lateral movement of\n     the
        toolbar section of the implement. The short lateral movement is\n     exacerbated
        by the positioning of the tool mounting bar being too close\n     to the frame
        structure that mounts to the tractor three-point hitch.\n     Mounting brackets
        further decrease the tool mounting bar clearance to the\n     frame structure.
        Pivoting-support-arms pivot in either direction limiting\n     the length
        of the lateral movement to much less than the length of the\n     pivoting-support-arms.
        The weight that these pivoting-support-arms can\n     support on the toolbar
        with heavy implements is dependent on the strength\n     of the pivot arms
        and their pivot joints. The pivot joints need to\n     sustain a tremendous
        weight load when handling a heavy implement as they\n     pivot side to side.
        This weight load is compounded and increased if the\n     pivoting-support-arms
        are increased in length.\n<BR><BR>[0010] Two-point hitch configurations present
        a different set of\n     limitations for use of lateral connection devices.
        The three-point hitch\n     invention differs from a two-point hitch in the
        mounting ability by\n     utilizing the advantage of the top-link arm attachment
        to the tractor\n     frame, the improved locations for the sleeves that provide
        the sliding\n     housings, a more versatile and stable two tier stacked movable
        implement\n     attachment section compared to the one movable toolbar and
        a more stable\n     and functional two or more tiered stacked movable implement
        attachment\n     section compared to the one movable implement attachment
        section.\n<BR><BR>[0011] Several patents teach methods of steering and controlling

        Existing systems for pulling or pushing implements suffer from a\n     significant
        disadvantage, particularly that the implement can go off\n     course, particularly
        during turns. This can result in destroyed crops,\n     inadequate application
        or over application of chemicals used for crops,\n     unplowed soil, and
        other deleterious effects. These problems can occur\n     even when the mobile
        machinery, such as a tractor, is on course.\n<BR><BR>[0013] Therefore, there
        is a need for a system that can allow an implement\n     to be pushed or pulled
        that helps maintain the implement on track, even\n     when the mobile machinery
        used for pulling or pushing the implement is\n     off track.\n<BR><BR>SUMMARY\n<BR><BR>[0014]
        A system according to the present invention that satisfies this\n     need
        includes a connecting apparatus suitable for connecting an implement\n     to
        a three-point hitch of mobile machinery, such as a tractor. The\n     connecting
        apparatus comprises a first framework disposed in a first\n     plane and
        comprising at least two parallel, vertically spaced-apart,\n     laterally
        extending rails. Three attachments are supported by the first\n     framework
        for attachment to the three-point hitch. The slidable second\n     framework
        is generally in the plane of the first framework and is mounted\n     on the
        rails to slide laterally along the rails. At least two connectors,\n     and
        typically three connectors, are supported by the slidable second\n     framework
        for connecting the slidable second framework to an implement\n     that can
        be pulled or pushed by the mobile machinery. At least one\n     driver, and
        for a robust apparatus, two drivers, are connected to the\n     first framework
        and connected to the second framework for driving the\n     slidable framework
        laterally back and forth along the rails.\n<BR><BR>[0015] In use of the apparatus,
        the position of the implement relative to\n     the mobile machinery is changed
        by the action of the driver, the driver\n     laterally moving the second
        framework.\n<BR><BR>[0016] Typically, the first framework comprises an upper
        cross beam and a\n     lower cross beam, each cross beam substantially parallel
        to the rails. In\n     a preferred version the first framework comprises at
        least two rails, at\n     least two vertically extending studs, the upper
        cross beam, and the lower\n     cross beam. The upper cross beam can support
        one of the attachments and\n     the lower cross beam can support two of the
        attachments, typically in a\n     triangular configuration.\n<BR><BR>[0017]
        The driver can be at least one hydraulic cylinder or at least one\n     electric
        linear actuator.\n<BR><BR>[0018] When a cylinder is used as part of the driver,
        the cylinder can be\n     provided with a stop for limiting lateral movement
        of the second\n     framework. The driver can be manually or automatically
        controlled. The\n     manual control can be a lever or the like. Also a switch
        can be provided\n     for switching between manual and automatic control.\n<BR><BR>[0019]
        Preferably there is a guidance system for automatically controlling\n     the
        driver to position the slidable second framework in a predetermined\n     pathway.
        The guidance system can comprise a GPS receiver, an underground\n     (buried)
        or above ground guidance wire, or a position signal receiver for\n     receiving
        a laser signal. The guidance system can comprise at least one\n     GPS positioning
        receiver mounted on the second framework for receiving\n     signals from
        the satellites or ground mounted base relay station to\n     determine the
        position of the slidable second framework, and a controller\n     for receiving
        position signals from the position signal receiver, the\n     controller adapted
        to control the driver to position the slidable second\n     framework in the
        predetermined pathway. The GPS guidance system utilizes\n     data input into
        a data input monitor to set the predetermined coordinates\n     of the mobile
        machinery and the connecting apparatus. GPS guidance can\n     control the
        mobile machinery steering in addition to the connecting\n     apparatus position.
        GPS positioning of the connecting apparatus in\n     conjunction with GPS
        steering of the mobile machinery is an advantage\n     over GPS steering of
        the mobile machinery alone while attempting to guide\n     an attached implement
        along a predetermined pathway. In a guidance wire\n     application, the guidance
        system can comprise at least one sensor mounted\n     on the second framework
        for receiving signals from the guidance wire. The\n     apparatus can comprise
        a position signal receiver supported by the\n     slidable second framework
        for determining the position of the slidable\n     second framework, and a

        controller adapted to control the driver to\n     position the slidable second
        framework in the predetermined pathway. In a\n     laser guidance application,
        generally there is no need for data entry\n     into a data entry monitor.
        The position of the laser receiver on the\n     connecting apparatus can position
        the connecting apparatus and steer the\n     tractor if tractor steering is
        preferred.\n<BR><BR>[0020] The second framework can comprise at least one
        sleeve for sliding\n     on at least one rail, and typically multiple sleeves

        that there be positioning indicia on the upper\n     cross beam of the first
        framework for positioning the second framework\n     relative to the first
        framework. This same type of positioning indicia\n     can be used on the
        lower cross beam of the first framework. Also, there\n     can be positioning
        indicia on one or more of the sleeves for adjusting\n     the position of
        any connector supported by the sleeve.\n<BR><BR>[0026] Preferably the apparatus
        includes a sensor for sensing the position\n     of the second framework relative
        to the first framework. This can be\n     combined with an alert generator
        that generates an alert, such as a sound\n     or flashing light, when the
        sensor senses that the second framework\n     slides beyond a predetermined
        position.\n<BR><BR>[0027] Preferably the apparatus includes a plumb gauge
        and a level gauge\n     for correctly adjusting the attitude and positioning
        of the implement.\n<BR><BR>[0028] Preferably at least one connector is laterally

        sensing the position of the implement. With the\n     connection guidance
        system, the system can include a method for\n     connecting the apparatus
        to the implement, where the implement has\n     hitches for connector with
        the connectors. The method comprises placing\n     the implement and apparatus
        approximate to each other, determine the\n     alignment of the connectors
        and the hitches, and adjusting the alignment\n     by sliding the second framework
        relative to the first framework.\n<BR><BR>[0030] The invention also includes
        a system where the mobile machinery,\n     the apparatus described above,
        and an implement are connected together,\n     with the apparatus attached

        the prior art. This side view\n     shows a Carry-All implement 300 mounted
        to the front and rear three-point\n     hitches of a tractor 38. Shown are
        the three points of attachment of a\n     three-point hitch to the Carry-All
        implement 300 using two bottom-link\n     attachment arms 318 and a top-link
        attachment arm 324. Two bottom link\n     attachment arms 318 (see FIG. 2)
        are generally positioned on the same\n     horizontal plane unless an application
        of use requires otherwise. Lift\n     link arms 330 are visible on the front
        three-point hitch while not being\n     visible on the rear three-point hitch
        being hidden by the larger rear\n     tires. In many farming and excavating
        instances a rear three-point hitch\n     is used by itself without a front
        three-point hitch being attached to the\n     tractor 38. Using a combined
        front and rear three-point hitch can\n     increase the efficiency of the
        farming or excavation application if used\n     properly.\n<BR><BR>[0298]
        FIG. 1b shows schematically a system according to the present\n     invention
        comprising a first connecting apparatus 40 attached to the\n     front and
        rear three-point hitches of a tractor in addition with the\n     Carry-All
        implement 300 mounted to the first connecting apparatus 40 at\n     front
        and rear locations. The connection apparatus 40 mounts first to the\n     three-point
        hitch of the tractor and the Carry-All implement 300 next\n     mounts to
        the connection apparatus 40.\n<BR><BR>[0299] FIG. 1c shows a close-up side
        view showing a tractor with the\n     connection apparatus 40 mounted to the
        rear three-point hitch of a\n     tractor with the prior art Carry-All implement
        300 mounted to the\n     connection apparatus showing top-link arm 324 attaching
        to the\n     rigid-frame top-link attachment 66, and the bottom link arms
        318\n     attaching to the rigid-frame bottom-link connection points 68 of
        the\n     connection apparatus 40. Sliding frame bottom-link quick hitch hook
        and\n     stop bar 136 attaches the lower portion of the Carry-All implement
        300 to\n     the sliding-frame 46 and sliding-frame top-link hook and stop
        bar 130\n     attaches the upper portion of the Carry-All implement 300 to
        the\n     sliding-frame 46. The sliding frame can be guided with a system
        using a\n     buried guidance wire 141 utilizing a signal generator 143 to
        activate the\n     guidance wire 141.\n<BR><BR>[0300] FIG. 2 shows the prior
        art implement 300, that includes a top\n     attachment receiver 312 which
        usually comprises a pair of spaced apart\n     aligned projections or flanges
        centrally disposed and having a hole there\n     through for receiving a distal
        end 326 of the top-link arm 324 which is\n     releasably held thereto by
        a pin or bolt 310. The distal end 326 can\n     comprise a socket. The opposing
        end 322 of the top-link arm 324 also\n     comprises a distal ball socket
        for attachment to the tractor top-link\n     attachment location with similar
        spaced apart projections and retaining\n     pin or bolt. The implement 300
        typically includes a transversely\n     extending tool bar or frame member
        having laterally spaced apart studs\n     314 extending from the tractor-facing
        side of the implement frame for\n     removable attachment to the bottom-link
        arm 320 sockets held within the\n     distal ends of the bottom-link arms
        318. In the alternative, laterally\n     spaced apart studs 314 are replaced
        with two flanges with axial centered\n     holes 195 (see FIG. 24) with a
        pin therein for connection to the\n     bottom-link arms 318. The distal end
        326 of the top-link arm 324 and\n     distal ends 320 of the two bottom-link
        arms 318 contain within sockets\n     having rotatable balls including apertures
        extending there-through for\n     insertion of pins for connecting these three
        ends to fixed points on the\n     implement. The top-link arm 324 includes
        a turn-buckle assembly with\n     threaded rods and a threaded hollow cylinder
        which can be rotated to\n     lengthen or shorten the overall length of the
        top-link arm 324.\n<BR><BR>[0301] FIGS. 3 shows prior art lift-link arms 330
        connect at lift-link\n     arms connection to bottom-link arms 332 that cause
        the bottom-link arms\n     318 to rotate upward and downward pivoting the
        proximate ends of the\n     bottom-link arms on a spindle and raising the
        distal end of the\n     bottom-link arms 320 and the implement attached thereto.
        The top-link arm\n     324, in turn, causes the upright portion of the carry-all
        implement 300\n     to maintain general uprightness or verticality. Consequently,
        the\n     horizontal portion of the implement remains generally horizontal\n
        \    throughout the upward and downward motion of the carry-all implement
        300\n     (see FIG. 2). Because the bottom-link arms 318 points of attachment
        to\n     the tractor under-carriage location 316 are also ball and socket\n
        \    arrangements, the implement is free to move laterally a fixed distance\n
        \    providing \"play\" for with respect to the tractor. In some situations,\n
        \    this freedom of movement is desirable, and in other situations,\n     undesirable.
        As in the case of this present invention, the freedom of\n     movement situation
        is undesirable, additional stabilizer arms are\n     connected, one to each
        of the bottom-link arms. One end of the stabilizer\n     arms connected approximately
        half way down the length of each bottom-link\n     arm 338, the other end
        is connected to a fixed point on the tractor\n     under-carriage location
        334 which is coaxial with the two bottom-link arm\n     connections to the
        tractor under carriage at location 316. This allows\n     full up and down
        movement of the implement but removes any random lateral\n     motion of the
        implement. The stabilizer arms 336 may be a turn-buckle\n     assembly with
        threaded rods and a threaded hollow cylinder which can be\n     rotated to
        lengthen or shorten the overall length of the stabilizer arm.\n     In the
        alternative, the stabilizer arms may be a rigid arm with an\n     adjustable
        threaded screw device located at the bottom-link arm location\n     338. Another
        alternative to the above stated stabilizer arms is one or\n     two stabilizer
        arms connected to a rigid point on the tractor and the\n     other end connected
        crossways to one or both of the bottom-link\n     connection pins 314 (see
        FIG. 2) to the implement.\n<BR><BR>[0302] Bottom-link arms 318 support the
        weight of the implement. Lift-link\n     arms 330 attach between the bottom-link
        arms 318 and tractor hydraulic\n     actuated lift arms at connection point
        328. The adjustable top-link arm\n     324 attaches to the tractor mounted
        top-link bracket 340 with a removable\n     pin or bolt thru the top-link
        arm distal end 322, which can have a\n     mounted rotatable ball, while the
        opposed distal end 326 of the top-link\n     arm has a rotatable ball and
        attaches to a top-link attachment plate 312\n     on the implement as shown
        in FIG. 2. A Power Take-Off shaft (PTO) (not\n     shown) can be disposed
        centered on the rear of the tractor through the\n     PTO pathway 98 in a
        plane between the height of the top-link attachment\n     plates 340 on the
        tractor and the bottom-link attachments 316 to the\n     tractor.\n<BR><BR>[0303]
        FIG. 5 and FIG. 6 show the tractor-facing side of the laterally\n     adjustable
        three-point hitch implement attachment, of a first version of\n     the invention,
        comprising a rigidly-mounted base frame 45 (also referred\n     to as a first
        framework), and a slidably-mounted frame 46 (also referred\n     to as a second
        framework). The rigidly-mounted base frame 45 is\n     configured for connection
        to the bottom-link arms 318 and top-link arm\n     324 of mobile machinery,
        such as the tractor 38 (see FIG. 1a).\n     Connections from the tractor to
        the rigidly-mounted base frame 45 occur\n     at the top link attachment 66
        and at the two bottom-link attachment 68.\n     The rigidly-mounted base frame
        45, also referred to as the first frame,\n     has at least two parallel,
        vertically spaced apart, laterally extending\n     rails. In the version shown
        in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6, the first frame 45\n     comprises four tiered horizontal
        longitudinal frame member rails 48, 49,\n     50, 51, which can be solid or
        hollow and any suitable shape in\n     cross-section, rigidly connected at
        the ends to at least two vertical\n     support members, also referred to
        as studs, and capable of being\n     removably secured to the three-point
        hitch of the tractor. Preferably in\n     the design of the rigidly-mounted
        base frame there are at least two upper\n     and two lower horizontal frame
        members providing an opening of sufficient\n     size between the upper and
        lower horizontal frame members to accommodate\n     a Power Take Off \"PTO\"
        driveline if required for the attached implement.\n     The PTO opening arraignment
        is shown in FIG. 7 using a double driver\n     configuration allowing for
        the space needed for the PTO driveline to\n     connect to an implement. FIG.
        5 and FIG. 6 show three upper and three\n     lower horizontal frame members
        for the rigidly-mounted base frame showing\n     the rigidly-mounted base
        frame with six horizontal longitudinal aligned\n     frame members, wherein
        frame member 47 (also referred to as upper cross\n     beam), 48 and 49 are
        in an upper position and frame members 50, 51, 52\n     (member 52 is also
        referred to as lower cross beam), are in a lower\n     positions, and four
        vertical frame members. Frame members 53 and 54, also\n     referred to as
        studs, are positioned to one side of the rigidly-mounted\n     base frame
        and frame members 55 and 56 are positioned to the opposing\n     side of the
        rigidly-mounted base frame. Members 53, 54, 55, and 56 are\n     also referred
        to as studs. Members 48, 49, 50, and 51 are also referred\n     to as rails.
        The laterally adjustable three-point hitch implement\n     attachment apparatus
        40 has square shaped horizontal sliding-frame\n     members 57,58,59,60 (also
        referred to as sleeves) and square shaped\n     horizontal rigid-frame members
        47,48,49,50,51,52 oriented in a diamond\n     shape with all sides placed
        at forty-five degree angles as compared to a\n     horizontal plane. By square
        shaped this is with regard to a vertical\n     cross section and preferably
        they are oriented with a corner facing\n     upwardly.\n<BR><BR>[0304] The
        slidable-mounted frame 46 comprises at least two horizontal\n     longitudinally
        aligned hollow frame member tubes securely and sturdily\n     connected at
        the ends with at least two vertical frame members forming a\n     generally
        rectangular sturdy frame that is transversely and\n     slidably-mounted on
        at least two horizontal longitudinal frame members,\n     bars or rails of
        the rigidly-mounted base frame 45 enabling the\n     slidable-mounted frame
        46 to travel transversely, also referred to as\n     laterally, across from
        one side to the other side of the rigidly-mounted\n     base frame 45. FIG.
        5 shows two upper and two lower horizontal hollow\n     frame members for
        the slidably-mounted frame, wherein frame members 57\n     and 58 are in the
        upper positions and frame members 59 and 60 are in the\n     lower positions.
        They slide on the rails of the base frame 45. Shown in\n     FIG. 5 are four
        vertical frame members, two vertical frame members 61 and\n     62 are positioned
        to one side and frame members 63 and 64 are positioned\n     to the opposing
        side. Frame members 61-64 are also referred to as posts.\n     Four hollow
        horizontal slidable-mounted frame members as opposed to two\n     hollow horizontal
        slidable-mounted frame members can provide a greater\n     load carrying capacity
        of the connecting apparatus.\n<BR><BR>[0305] The upper horizontal rigidly-mounted
        base frame members 48 and 49\n     pass thru the upper slidable-mounted frame
        members 57 and 58. The lower\n     horizontal rigidly-mounted base frame members
        50 and 51 pass thru the\n     lower slidable-mounted frame members 59 and
        60. The slidable-mounted\n     frame 46 is free to laterally move with respect
        to the rigidly-mounted\n     base frame 45. All six rigidly-mounted base frame
        members and all four\n     slidable-mounted frame members are typically vertically
        coplanar. While\n     FIG. 5 and subsequent figures show a frame made from
        longitudinal members\n     having a rectangular or square cross-section, it
        is contemplated that\n     longitudinal members may be formed having a cylindrical
        cross-sectional\n     area such as pipes or solid rods (see FIG. 39b). FIG.
        5 and subsequent\n     figures show the square frame members turned in a diagonal
        horizontal\n     position representing a diamond shape, the connecting apparatus
        would\n     also work in a similar fashion with the frame members turned in
        the\n     square position with the bottom and top of the frame members situated
        in\n     a horizontal squared position (see FIG. 39a) as opposed to a forty-five\n
        \    degree diamond slanted position when compared to a horizontal plane.\n<BR><BR>[0306]
        As depicted in subsequent drawings, (see FIGS. 13, 14, 15, 16) a\n     lighter
        more economical version of the connecting apparatus 40 as\n     depicted in
        FIG. 5 can be configured with only two hollow horizontal\n     frame members
        included in the slidably-mounted frame 46 and only four\n     horizontal frame
        members included in the rigidly-mounted base frame 45.\n     (see FIGS. 13,
        14, 15, 16) In addition to the connecting apparatus as\n     depicted in FIG.
        5, a larger stronger version of the connecting apparatus\n     can be configured
        by increasing the number of horizontal frame members\n     included in the
        slidably-mounted frame to six or more (not shown) and\n     increasing number
        of horizontal frame members in the rigidly-mounted\n     frame to eight or
        more. (not shown) Also in addition to adding horizontal\n     and vertical
        frame members to gain more strength and weight carrying\n     capacity of
        the connecting apparatus, using a stronger or greater\n     diameter and thickness
        of the metal used in all of the frame members will\n     achieve a greater
        weigh carrying and working capacity. For great weight\n     carrying and working
        capacity of the connecting apparatus, all of the\n     rigidly-mounted base
        frame horizontal frame members can be constructed of\n     solid steel bars.\n<BR><BR>[0307]
        FIG. 6 shows a single location of top-link attachment plate 66 and\n     two
        locations of bottom-link attachment plates 68 located on the\n     rigidly-mounted
        frame 45, which are for attachment to the tractor\n     top-link and bottom-link
        points, respectively, of the three-point hitch.\n     Four horizontal sliding-frame
        members or sleeves are shown. Pushing or\n     pulling means such as a hydraulic
        actuator and cylinder, electric\n     actuator and cylinder, pneumatic actuator
        and cylinder, other positioning\n     devices, chain, cable, belt or combinations
        thereof are provided for\n     moving the slidable-mounted frame 46 laterally
        and parallel to the\n     rigidly-mounted frame 45.\n<BR><BR>[0308] For example,
        a single hydraulic driver 80 is mounted for the\n     lateral adjustments
        of the sliding-frame 46. The hydraulic driver 80\n     provides lateral movement
        of the slidably-mounted frame 46 across the\n     rigidly-mounted base frame
        45. The slidably-mounted frame 46 is free to\n     slide laterally with respect
        to the base frame 45. The left-right\n     movement and position of slidably-mounted
        frame 46 is changed by at least\n     one hydraulic driver 80 comprising a
        housing 82 and a piston 83, or\n     optionally more than one driver, such
        as two hydraulic drivers 80 (see\n     FIG. 7). Typically, the driver has
        an internal stop for limiting the\n     lateral movement of the slidably-mounted
        frame 46. The hydraulic driver\n     is connected between the rigidly-mounted
        base frame 45 and the\n     slidably-mounted frame 46. The cylinder housing
        82 of the hydraulic\n     driver 80 is removably attached at one end to a
        bracket 90 with a pin and\n     clip and the bracket 90 is connected to bracket
        92b which is connected to\n     the rigidly-mounted base frame 45 at vertical
        frame member 56. The piston\n     83 of the hydraulic driver 80 is removably
        attached to a bracket 89 with\n     a pin and clip and the bracket 89 is connected
        to a bracket 94b which is\n     connected to the slidably-mounted frame 46
        at the vertical frame member\n     61. In this configuration, when the piston
        83 of the hydraulic driver 80\n     moves out of the housing 82, the slidably-mounted
        frame 46 is caused to\n     slide away from the bracket 90 of the rigidly-mounted
        base frame 45. When\n     the piston 83 of the hydraulic driver 80 moves back
        into housing 82, the\n     slidably-mounted frame 46 is caused to move closer
        to the bracket 90 of\n     the rigidly-mounted base frame 45. The hydraulic
        cylinder housing 82 has\n     two hydraulic flexible lines 85 attached which
        in turn can be attached to\n     a tractor manual hydraulic control valve
        236 and the automated hydraulic\n     control valve 238. The driver 80 can
        be operated manually or\n     automatically.\n<BR><BR>[0309] The single hydraulic
        cylinder 80 is mounted in a centered location\n     between the top and bottom
        of the sliding-frame 46 for lateral adjustment\n     of the sliding-frame
        46. The single hydraulic cylinder centered design\n     can be used when a
        Power Take Off \"PTO\" driveline is not required for the\n     implement that
        is attached to the connection apparatus as this centered\n     single hydraulic
        cylinder position would obstruct the pathway 98 of a PTO\n     driveline (see
        FIG. 7) as it is connected between the tractor PTO shaft\n     and the implement
        to be attached to the connection apparatus.\n<BR><BR>[0310] The driver typically
        has static loading capacity, meaning that when\n     the driver stops and
        reaches a predetermined adjustment point, the driver\n     essentially locks
        in place and can support a load that is either pulling\n     or pushing on
        the driver. Typically, in an agricultural tractor\n     application, the tractor
        hydraulic system control valves and hydraulic\n     cylinders are valved for
        a static loading capacity. Typical electric\n     linear actuators that are
        screw or gear driven generally have a static\n     loading capacity or an
        electro-mechanical brake added to provide improved\n     static loading capacity.\n<BR><BR>[0311]
        Preferably hydraulic drivers are used as compared to electric,\n     sprocket
        and chain drives, pneumatic drives and electro-magnetic drives.\n     Hydraulic
        actuators are rugged and suited for high-force applications.\n     They can
        produce forces 25 times greater than pneumatic cylinders of\n     equal size.
        They also operate in pressures of up to 4,000 psi.\n<BR><BR>[0312] Electric
        motor actuator drives are weak and usually expensive\n     compared to hydraulic
        cylinder movement applications. Electrical\n     actuators can be used, because
        they have fewer component parts and can\n     provide precision-control positioning.
        An example of the range of\n     accuracy is +/-0.0003 in. and a repeatability
        of less than 0.00004 in.\n     Their setups are scalable for any purpose or
        force requirement, and are\n     quiet, smooth, and repeatable. The initial
        unit cost of an electrical\n     actuator is higher than that of pneumatic
        and hydraulic actuators.\n<BR><BR>[0313] Sprocket and chain drives can be
        used, but they have slack between\n     the parts causing less precise movement
        when compared to a hydraulic\n     cylinder positioning system.\n<BR><BR>[0314]
        Pneumatic cylinder drives can be used but they have limited\n     position
        control Electro-magnetic actuators such as linear motor\n     actuators, although
        possible in this application, generally do not\n     possess sufficient force
        capacity for linear movement. Linear motor\n     actuators do have the advantage
        of being able to be sealed very easily\n     against moisture and corrosion
        allowing for a long service life. As\n     technology advances, electro-magnetic
        actuators may be a preferred choice\n     in many applications. Mechanical
        actuator means only of controlling the\n     driver may be useful in a limited
        number of applications using mobile\n     machinery.\n<BR><BR>[0315] Manual
        operational control of the hydraulic or electric driver can\n     be preferred
        in some applications while using the connecting apparatus. A\n     switch
        switching between manual and automatic control of the driver can\n     be
        provided along with a manual control valve or switch. One instance\n     when
        manual control of the driver may be utilized is when then mobile\n     machine
        operator is attaching or removing implements from the connecting\n     apparatus.
        The manually operated valve or switch would provide manual\n     lateral positioning
        of the connecting apparatus slidable frame for hookup\n     of an implement.
        Another instance where manual operation of the driver\n     may be utilized
        is when the mobile machine operator has no automatic\n     guidance system
        setup for use or the mobile machine operator simply\n     prefers the manual
        operation of the driver in certain applications.\n<BR><BR>[0316] Also shown
        in FIG. 6 is the rear face of the double wrap-around\n     bracket clamps
        78, which are used for the opposing implement side\n     connection.\n<BR><BR>[0317]
        Attachment plates 66 are mounted on the tractor facing side of the\n     rigidly-mounted
        base frame 45 top horizontal frame member 47 for\n     connection of the top-link
        arm 324 (see FIG. 1c) to the tractor top-link\n     attachment brackets 340
        (see FIG. 3). Two attachment plates 68 are\n     mounted on the tractor facing
        side of the rigidly-mounted base frame 45\n     bottom horizontal frame member
        52 for hookup of the tractor bottom-link\n     arms 318 (see FIG. 3) to the
        connecting apparatus. Top-link attachment\n     plates 66 includes two vertical
        parallel plates or flanges defining a\n     bracket with coaxial aligned thorough
        holes projecting outward or upward\n     from the surface of the rigidly-mounted
        base frame top horizontal member\n     47 which provides for connecting a
        top-link arm 324 (see FIG. 1b) to the\n     tractor. Bottom-link attachment
        plates 68 include two vertical parallel\n     plates or flanges defining a
        bracket with coaxial aligned thorough holes\n     projecting outward or outward
        and upward from the surface of the\n     rigidly-mounted base frame bottom
        horizontal member 52 which provides for\n     connecting the two bottom-link
        arms 318 (see FIG. 3) of the tractor to\n     the rigidly-mounted base frame
        45.\n<BR><BR>[0318] At least four grease fittings 74 for each horizontal frame
        member\n     of the slidable-mounted frame 46 are provided to lubricate the
        sliding\n     action of the slidable-mounted frame 46 upon the rigidly mounted
        frame\n     45. Optimally, sixteen or more grease fittings are provided for
        each\n     horizontal frame member of the slidably-mounted frame 46 for complete\n
        \    coverage of lubricant between the two frames. Grease fittings 74 are\n
        \    shown mounted on the slidable-mounted frame 46 screwed into threaded\n
        \    holes or fittings on all sliding horizontal frame members of the\n     sliding-frame
        46.\n<BR><BR>[0319] Shown in FIG. 6 are viewable rigid-frame alignment marks
        70, also\n     referred to as positioning indicia, located on the upper rigid-frame\n
        \    horizontal frame member 47 marking the edge of the sliding-frame when
        the\n     sliding-frame is centered on the rigid frame, the rigid-frame alignment\n
        \    marks 70 located on the lower rigid-frame horizontal frame member 52\n
        \    marking the edge of the sliding-frame when the sliding-frame is centered\n
        \    on the rigid frame. A rigid-frame alignment mark 72, also referred to
        as\n     positioning indicia, is located on the lower rigid-frame horizontal
        frame\n     member 52 for marking the center of the sliding-frame when the\n
        \    sliding-frame is centered on the rigid-frame. This allows centering of\n
        \    the slidable frame. For the upper rigid-frame horizontal frame member
        47,\n     the rigid-frame top-link attachment plates 66 serves as a center
        mark.\n     The hydraulic cylinder 80 length and rigidly-mounted frame section
        45\n     width can be altered depending on the length of lateral movement
        required\n     of the sliding-frame section 46.\n<BR><BR>[0320] FIG. 6 shows
        the hydraulic lines 85 connected between the hydraulic\n     driver 80 and
        both the manual hydraulic control valve 236 and the\n     automatic hydraulic
        control valve 238. FIG. 7 show hydraulic lines 87\n     connected between
        a hydraulic flow divider 88 and both the manual\n     hydraulic control valve
        236 and the automatic hydraulic control valve\n     238. FIG. 6 and FIG. 7
        show hydraulic lines 87a connected between the\n     manual hydraulic control
        valve 236 and a hydraulic valve selector switch\n     240. Hydraulic lines
        87b are connected between the automatic hydraulic\n     control valve 238
        and the hydraulic valve selector switch 240. Hydraulic\n     lines 87c are
        connected between the hydraulic valve selector switch 240\n     and the hydraulic
        pump 81. Hydraulic power receptacle 242 comprising dual\n     quick connect
        couplers serve as the hydraulic power receptacle and\n     connect and disconnect
        means for the hydraulic lines when attaching or\n     removing the first connecting
        apparatus 40 from the tractor three-point\n     hitch.\n<BR><BR>[0321] With
        reference to FIG. 7, a laser receiver and a GPS antenna and\n     receiver
        module 110e is also shown mounted on the top bar 100a. A choice\n     can
        be made as to which receiver and controller is used depending on the\n     application.
        Both receivers normally are not used at the same time. A GPS\n     controller
        can be required to be matched to the GPS antenna and receiver\n     module
        110e; likewise, a laser controller can be required to be matched\n     to
        the laser receiver 110. Each receiver receives a signal from a\n     transmitter
        and then relays a signal that can be digital or analog or\n     other to the
        controller 150 through signal wire 110d or 110f. A data\n     entry monitor
        150b can be provided if required to enter data to the\n     controller such
        as in the case of the GPS controller. Data wire 150c is\n     connected from
        the data entry monitor 150b to the controller 150. (see\n     FIGS. 6 and
        7) The controller 150 sends a signal 150a to the automatic\n     hydraulic
        control valve 238. (see FIGS. 6 and 7) In the instance where an\n     electric
        actuator is used for the driver 80, FIG. 4b shows the\n     configuration
        of the electrical components for the operation of the\n     driver 80.\n<BR><BR>[0322]
        FIG. 7 shows a double hydraulic cylinder providing lateral movement\n     of
        the slidably-mounted frame 46 across the rigidly-mounted base frame\n     45.
        The double hydraulic cylinder design can be used when a Power Take\n     Off
        (\"PTO\") driveline is required for the implement that is attached to\n     the
        connection apparatus, as this double hydraulic cylinder design\n     normally
        does not obstruct the pathway of a PTO driveline as it is\n     connected
        between the tractor PTO shaft and the implement to be attached\n     to the
        connection apparatus. In addition, heavy loads that may be mounted\n     on
        the connection apparatus can benefit from the double hydraulic\n     cylinder
        design by spreading out the push-pull force of the hydraulic\n     cylinders
        to two locations of the sliding-frame 46 instead of one\n     location. The
        slidably-mounted frame 46 is free to slide laterally with\n     respect to
        the base frame 45.\n<BR><BR>[0323] The left-right movement and position of
        slidably-mounted frame 46\n     is controlled by two hydraulic drivers 80.
        Each hydraulic driver is\n     connected between the rigidly-mounted base
        frame 45 and the second\n     slidably-mounted frame 46. The housing 82 (see
        FIG. 6) of the top\n     hydraulic cylinder 80 is connected at one end to
        the bracket 90 which is\n     connected to brackets 92a which are connected
        to the rigidly-mounted base\n     frame 45 at vertical frame member 56. The
        piston 83 of the top hydraulic\n     driver 80 is connected at one end to
        the bracket 89 which is connected to\n     bracket 94a which is connected
        to the slidably-mounted frame 46 at\n     vertical frame member 61. The housing
        82 of the bottom hydraulic driver\n     80 is connected at one end to the
        bracket 90 which is connected to\n     bracket 92c which is connected to the
        rigidly-mounted base frame 45 at\n     vertical frame member 56. The piston
        83 of the bottom hydraulic driver 80\n     is connected at one end to the
        bracket 89 which is connected to bracket\n     94c which is connected to the
        slidably-mounted frame 46 at vertical frame\n     member 61. In this double
        hydraulic driver configuration, when the\n     pistons 83 of the hydraulic
        drivers 80 moves out of hydraulic housing,\n     the slidably-mounted frame
        46 is caused to slide away from the bracket 90\n     of the base frame 45.
        When the pistons 83 of the hydraulic driver 80\n     moves back into the housings
        82, slidably-mounted frame 46 is caused to\n     move closer to brackets 90
        of the base frame 45. In the double hydraulic\n     cylinder configuration,
        the hydraulic fluid flow divider 88 is utilized\n     to provide even distribution
        of hydraulic fluid to each hydraulic driver\n     80, causing both hydraulic
        drivers 80 to be synchronized with each other\n     while moving in parallel
        to provide the lateral movement of the\n     slidably-mounted frame 46 with
        respect to the rigidly-mounted base frame\n     45. Hydraulic lines 86 are
        disposed between each hydraulic cylinder 80\n     and the hydraulic fluid
        flow divider 88 for even fluid distribution to\n     the hydraulic cylinders
        80 while hydraulic lines 87 are disposed between\n     the hydraulic fluid
        flow divider 88 and the hydraulic control valve\n     normally equipped on
        a tractor carrying the connecting apparatus. The\n     double hydraulic cylinder
        configuration can be helpful in moving the\n     slidably-mounted frame 46
        when the implement to be carried by the\n     connecting apparatus is of the
        larger and heavier nature.\n<BR><BR>[0324] With reference to FIGS. 7 and 8,
        a top-bar first bar 100a is\n     rigidly attached to the slidably-mounted
        frame section 46 with attachment\n     legs 101. The top-bar first bar 100a
        supports (i) a laterally adjustably\n     positioned laser receiver 110 or
        a GPS antenna and receiver module 110e\n     provided with an adjustable holding
        bracket 108 for supporting a GPS or a\n     laser guidance system, (ii) an
        LED light fixture 118, and (iii) mounted\n     camera housing 112 comprising
        two cameras 114 and 116 focused rearwardly\n     and downwardly, respectively,
        being mounted on a slidable bar 104 for\n     lateral adjustment. The separate
        viewing cameras 114 and 116 are enclosed\n     in the camera housing 112.
        Top-bar 100a has a top-bar plate 100c for the\n     mounting of the GPS antenna
        and receiver module 110e with dual antennas\n     (see FIG. 11). The slidably-mounted
        frame 46 horizontal frame members and\n     the top-bar first bar 100a have
        indicia markings, also referred to as\n     positioning indicia, laid down
        in inches or millimeters thereon, to\n     provide useful adjustment marks.
        Laser receiver 110 has a left alignment\n     indicator 110a, center alignment
        indicator 110b and a right alignment\n     indicator 110c. The top-bar first
        bar 100a extends laterally beyond the\n     slidable frame 46 as is needed.
        A position-sensor 151 is attached to\n     the-top-bar mounting leg 101. A
        position-sensor bar 151a is attached to\n     the rigid-frame horizontal frame
        member 47 with position-sensor bar\n     attachment brackets 152, with position
        sensor electrical wires 152a\n     extending from position sensor bar 151a.\n<BR><BR>[0325]
        With reference to FIG. 7, optionally the position signal receiver\n     110
        or 110e, such as a GPS or laser signal receiver, supported by the\n     slidable
        second framework, can determine the position of slidable second\n     framework,
        and can provide a position signal through signal wires 110d or\n     110f
        the controller 150. The controller 150 is adapted to control the\n     driver
        80 for keeping the implement on track via the controller output\n     signal
        150a to the automated hydraulic valve that controls the driver 80.\n     A
        suitable programmed controller 150 that can provide output signals can\n     be
        obtained from by Trimble of Sunnyvale, Calif. for either the laser or\n     GPS
        system.\n<BR><BR>[0326] FIG. 8 is a perspective view of the implement-facing
        side of the\n     connecting apparatus 40. The slidably-mounted frame 46 provides\n
        \    connection means for most three-point hitch implements in the\n     agricultural
        and earth excavating fields, such as bed shapers, seed\n     planters, plant
        transplanters, cultivators, weeders, sprayers, rippers,\n     box scrapers
        and the like. The slidably-mounted frame 46 is fitted with\n     two double-frame
        member wrap around bracket clamps 78, which are mounted\n     to the slidably-mounted
        horizontal frame sleeves 59 and 60. Sliding-frame\n     bottom-link mounting
        arms 132 attach to two double wrap-around bracket\n     clamps 78 which protrude
        out towards the implement to be attached.\n     Sliding-frame bottom-link
        quick-hitch slip-on housing 135, as described\n     in U.S. Pat. No. 7,059,419,
        attach and secure over the sliding-frame\n     bottom-link mounting arms 132.
        (see FIG. 23) The bottom-link attachment\n     points are normally spaced
        between 20 and 36 inches apart in a centered\n     location on the slidably-mounted
        frame 46 and located near the horizontal\n     plane of sliding-frame member
        60. The slidably-mounted frame 46 is also\n     fitted with a top-link quick
        hitch attachment point attached to the\n     double wrap-around bracket clamp
        78 which is mounted to slidably-mounted\n     horizontal frame members 57
        and 58. The top-link quick hitch attachment\n     point is normally horizontally
        centered between left and right on the\n     slidably-mounted frame 46 and
        adjustably located near or between the\n     horizontal planes of sliding-frame
        members 57 and 58. The two\n     sliding-frame bottom-link attachment hooks
        136 and latching mechanism 139\n     combined with the sliding-frame top-link
        hook 130 provides for quick and\n     easy attachment of a three-point hitch
        implement such as the carry-all\n     300 (see FIG. 2) and serve as connectors.\n<BR><BR>[0327]
        The rigid-frame alignment marks 70 are located on the top\n     rigid-frame
        horizontal frame member 47 marking the edge of the\n     sliding-frame when
        the sliding-frame is centered on the rigid frame. The\n     rigid-frame alignment
        mark 72 located on the top rigid-frame horizontal\n     frame member 47 marks
        the center of the sliding-frame when the\n     sliding-frame is centered on
        the rigid frame. Rigid-frame alignment marks\n     70 located on the bottom
        rigid-frame horizontal frame member 52 mark the\n     edge of the sliding-frame
        when the sliding-frame is centered on the rigid\n     frame. The rigid-frame
        alignment mark 72 located on the bottom\n     rigid-frame horizontal frame
        member 52 marks the center of the\n     sliding-frame when the sliding-frame
        is centered on the rigid frame.\n<BR><BR>[0328] With reference to FIGS. 14
        and 23, there is shown the sliding-frame\n     bottom-link mounting arms 132
        and rotatable ball joints 134 that are\n     normally located on the end of
        a tractor's bottom-link arms 318. (see\n     FIG. 1c) Serving as the bottom
        connector on the sliding frame is a\n     quick-hitch slip on housing 135
        as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,059,419.\n     Connector 135 securely mounts
        over the sliding-frame bottom-link mounting\n     arms 132. The sliding-frame
        bottom-link quick hitch slip on housing 135\n     and latching mechanism 139
        allow for a quick hookup and release of the\n     implement from the tractor
        bottom-link arms. Direct hookup of\n     sliding-frame bottom-link mounting
        arms 132 (see FIG. 14) to the\n     implement is a more cumbersome hookup
        procedure as compared to the quick\n     hitch style of implement hookup,
        although this direct sliding-frame\n     bottom-link mounting arm 132 hookup
        may provide a more secure and tighter\n     fit to the implement in very precise
        method of use applications. The\n     quick hitch slip on housing 135, U.S.
        Pat. No. 7,059,419 includes a hook\n     means 136 open at the top and a manually
        or spring operated latch 139 as\n     shown in a close up view (see FIG. 23).
        This close-up view shows the slip\n     on housing slips over the sliding-frame
        bottom-link mounting arm 132 and\n     is then held in place by a pin which
        enters the slip on housing 135 and\n     then extends through the rotatable
        socket and ball with axial hole of arm\n     132. Additional securing and
        adjustment screws are located around the\n     slip on housing 135 for fine
        adjustments and a tight level fit.\n<BR><BR>[0329] With reference to FIG.
        8, the top-link quick hitch attachment\n     comprises a top-link channel
        back spacer 119 to vertically align the\n     top-link quick hitch attachment
        points with the sliding-frame bottom-link\n     quick hitch attachment points
        136. An additional top-link bracket spacer\n     121 is attached between the
        double wrap around bracket clamp 78 and the\n     top-link channel back spacer
        119 to provide access to the double\n     wrap-around bracket clamp 78 mounting
        bolts. Attached to the top-link\n     channel back spacer 119 is an adjustable
        mounting channel 122. Bolted\n     into the adjustable mounting channel 122
        is a sliding-frame top-link hook\n     and stop bar 130 top-link channel side
        spacers 120 inserted and bolted\n     through. The sliding-frame top-link
        hook 130 generally is deeper and\n     longer than the sliding-frame bottom-link
        quick-hitch hook and stop bar\n     136, the sliding-frame top-link hook 130
        does not generally perform\n     lifting functions of the attached implements,
        the sliding-frame top-link\n     hook 130 hooks under and then up to catch
        the top-link hookup connection\n     on the implement 312 (see FIG. 2) and
        holds the implement in place and\n     allows the adjustment of tilting forward
        and backwards performed by the\n     tractor mounted top-link arm 324. (see
        FIG. 1c) Top-link arm 324 is\n     mounted to the tractor at location 340
        (see FIG. 3) and to the connecting\n     apparatus, and in many applications
        can be a double action hydraulic\n     cylinder performing tilting adjustments
        for the attached implement.\n<BR><BR>[0330] FIG. 9 is a perspective view of
        the implement facing side of the\n     connecting apparatus, showing the sliding-frame
        bottom-link housing 138\n     attached to the adjustable mounting channel
        122 which traverses the four\n     horizontal frame members 57, 58, 59, 60
        of the sliding-frame 46. The\n     adjustable mounting channel 122 attaches
        to two double wrap-around\n     bracket clamps 78 of the sliding-frame 46.
        The adjustable mounting\n     channel 122 in this configuration can provide
        additional bottom-link\n     higher or lower adjustments and added strength
        to the sliding-frame 46\n     while allowing space for an implement PTO driveline
        to pass through the\n     connecting apparatus from the implement being carried
        to the tractor PTO\n     shaft. A sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch bolt-on
        housing 138 can be\n     provided in place of the sliding-frame bottom-link
        quick-hitch slip-on\n     housing 135, U.S. Pat. No. 7,059,419. The sliding-frame
        bottom-link\n     quick-hitch bolt-on housing 138 can be a more stable attachment
        for the\n     bottom-link connection point to the implement of the connecting
        apparatus\n     as compared to the sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch slip-on
        housing\n     135. In the alternative for connecting an implement to the connecting\n
        \    apparatus, the sliding-frame bottom-link mounting arm and ball socket,\n
        \    bolt-on 133, as shown in FIG. 20, can be used in place of the\n     sliding-frame
        bottom-link quick-hitch bolt-on housing 138 to provide a\n     more stable
        attachment of the implement to the connecting apparatus. The\n     position-sensor
        151 sliding-frame mounted is attached to a top-bar\n     mounting leg 101.\n<BR><BR>[0331]
        The position-sensor bar 151a is rigid-frame mounted, and is\n     attached
        to the top rigid-frame horizontal frame member 47 with\n     position-sensor
        bar attachment brackets 152. Position sensor electrical\n     wires 152b and
        the position sensor bar electrical wires 152a extend from\n     both position
        sensor 151 and position sensor bar 151a to provide the\n     conductors for
        the position sensor signal 151b and the position sensor\n     bar signal 151c.
        Optionally a wireless connection can be used. The\n     position sensor 151
        and the position sensor bar 151a can send a visual\n     screen signal 153e
        for an operator's viewable positioning screen 153d for\n     the tractor operator
        to view the position of the slidable-frame 46\n     position as related to
        the rigid-frame 45 position while looking forward\n     and away from the
        rear three-point hitch mounted connecting apparatus.\n     This allows the
        tractor operator to reposition the rigid-frame 45 by\n     repositioning the
        tractor using the tractors steering if the tractor is\n     diverging from
        the prescribed path. Auto-steering of the tractor can also\n     be utilized
        by configuring the position sensor 151 and the position\n     sensor bar 151a
        with an automated auto-steer controller 153 utilizing an\n     auto-steer
        controller signal 153a sent to the auto-steer device 153b to\n     control
        the steering of the tractor. The auto-steer controller can be\n     equipped
        with an auto-steer controller on-off switch 153c to allow the\n     tractor
        operator to manually steer the tractor when necessary.\n<BR><BR>[0332] In
        the instance the auto-steer function is utilized, and in the\n     instance
        the tractor is to be steered in a straight line only by the\n     auto-steer
        function, mounting the connecting apparatus on the rear\n     three-point
        hitch of a front wheel steered tractor is sufficient to keep\n     the tractor
        in a straight line. In the instance a front wheel steered\n     tractor is
        required to auto-steer in a path that is not a straight line\n     such as
        turns, the connecting apparatus 40 can be mounted on the front of\n     the
        tractor for precise steering along a predetermined path. In this\n     instance
        the present apparatus 40 can be mounted on the front three-point\n     hitch
        of the tractor and another apparatus 40 can be mounted on the rear\n     three-point
        hitch of the tractor depending on the application and\n     implements being
        used. In the alternative to mounting the apparatus 40 on\n     the front of
        a front wheel steered tractor in a situation where the\n     predetermined
        path follows turns and the apparatus 40 is required to be\n     mounted on
        the rear three-point hitch of the tractor, a separate auto\n     steer device
        can be mounted on the front of the tractor to achieve\n     sufficient auto-steering
        results in a predetermined path following turns.\n<BR><BR>[0333] Optionally
        for mobile machinery equipped with an auto-steering\n     system 153 and 153b,
        such as those provided by Trimble of Sunnyvale,\n     Calif., the position
        sensor 151 sensing the position of the second\n     framework relative to
        the first framework, can use the auto-steer system\n     for automatically
        adjusting the position of the mobile machinery based on\n     the sensed position
        of the second framework relative to the first\n     framework. Current auto-steering
        devices work by either controlling the\n     hydraulic fluid of the mobile
        machinery hydraulic steering system or\n     controlling the mechanical steering
        wheel of the mobile machinery.\n<BR><BR>[0334] FIG. 10 is a perspective view
        of the implement facing side of the\n     connecting apparatus 40, showing

        configuration of the\n     sliding-frame for the bottom-link connections to
        the implement. This\n     configuration expands the pathway 98 for a PTO driveline
        as compared to\n     FIG. 9. Grease fittings, also referred to as great joints
        74, are shown.\n     Two viewable gauges level measurement 146 are secured
        to a gauge mounting\n     plate 145 mounted on the top and at each end of
        the rigid-frame top\n     horizontal frame member 47, and situated to be viewed
        from the rear of\n     the tractor such as from the tractor seat area allowing
        the tractor\n     operator to view and adjust the connecting apparatus accordingly.
        Two\n     viewable gauges plumb measurement 147 are mounted on the side, near
        the\n     top of each rigid-frame vertical frame member 53 and 56. One auto-sensor\n
        \    gauge level measurement 148 is mounted on one of the gauge mounting\n

        \    auto-sensor gauge plumb measurement 149 is mounted on the side, near
        the\n     top of rigid-frame vertical frame member 53. The auto-sensor devices
        can\n     automate the level and plumb positions of the connecting apparatus\n
        \    utilizing the tractor installed hydraulic positioning of the tractors\n
        \    three-point hitch. This automated leveling and plumbing of the connecting\n
        \    apparatus requires the tractor three-point hitch to accommodate\n     controlled
        hydraulic cylinders at the top-link arm 324 and on at least\n     one of the
        bottom-link arms 318.\n<BR><BR>[0335] A bottom-bar 140 is mounted on the bottom
        of the slidable-mounted\n     frame 46 and below the sliding-frame bottom-link
        138, and below a double\n     wrap-around bracket clamp 78 being securely
        fastened to the\n     slidable-mounted frame 46 with bottom-bar mounting legs
        142. Bottom-bar\n     sensor or cameras 144 are securely mounted to the underside
        of the\n     bottom-bar 140, in the case of sensors, for the detection of
        electronic\n     signals transmitted from an underground buried cable in which
        the\n     slidable-mounted frame 46 adjusts laterally to follow the path of
        the\n     signal transmitted from the underground buried cable. In the case
        of\n     cameras, recognition computer software can be used to detect the
        position\n     of crops or other items like line markers or shapes to adjust
        the\n     slidably-mounted frame 46 in position. Bottom-bar signal wire 144a
        can\n     transmit the signal to controller 150 (see FIG. 6) utilizing the

        controlled wing sections 221 that\n     attach to the left and right side
        edges of the rigidly-mounted base frame\n     45 of the connecting apparatus
        40. The wing sections 221 comprise their\n     own rigidly-mounted base frame
        45 and their own slidably-mounted frame\n     46. All three slidably-mounted
        frames 46 move independently of each\n     other. The wing sections 221 can
        be utilized for carrying lighter duty\n     implements such as weeders, sprayers,
        cutters and the like. The wing\n     sections 221 attach to the three-point
        attached first connecting\n     apparatus 40 using a hinge. A piano style
        hinge 230 can be a suitable\n     preferred attachment device to utilize for
        the attachment and pivoting\n     action of the wing section 221 as connected
        to the three-point attached\n     first connecting apparatus 40 left and right
        side edges. Attachment\n     hardware 224 and 226 allows for a push pull means
        such as a hydraulic\n     cylinder 228 to be mounted on the first connecting
        apparatus 40 and on\n     each wing section 221 at the joining corners at
        the top and bottom of the\n     three rigidly mounted frame sections 45. Each
        wing section 221 pivoting\n     action can be controlled separately apart
        from the opposing wing section\n     allowing for individual control of the
        wing sections. Two hydraulic\n     cylinders 228 for each wing section 221
        can work in tandem using a\n     hydraulic fluid flow divider 232 between
        the hydraulic cylinders 228 and\n     the tractor mounted hydraulic control
        valve 234. For control of the\n     slidably mounted frames 46 on each wing
        sections 221, the wing section\n     driver 80 can attach directly between
        the rigidly mounted first frame 45\n     and the slidably mounted frame 46
        using the attachment bracket 89 to the\n     driver 80 piston arm and the
        attachment bracket 90 to the driver 80\n     cylinder housing. The mounted
        position of the driver 80 on the wing\n     section differs from the mounting
        position of the driver 80 on the first\n     connecting apparatus 40. This
        difference is the result of the offset\n     positioning of the wing section
        221 slidably-mounted frame 46 as mounted\n     on the rigidly mounted first
        frame 45.\n<BR><BR>[0371] Shown are hydraulic fluid lines 84 from the hydraulic
        control valve\n     234 leading to a hydraulic power pump 81, and showing
        the hydraulic fluid\n     lines 86 from the hydraulic cylinder 228 to the
        hydraulic flow divider 88\n     and showing the hydraulic fluid lines 87 from
        the hydraulic flow divider\n     88 to the hydraulic control valve 234.\n<BR><BR>[0372]
        For hydraulic or electrically powered devices for driving the\n     second
        framework of each wing section 221, such as a hydraulic or\n     electrically
        powered cylinder, or for locally pumped fluid, a power\n     receptacle can
        be provided on the first framework 45 of the first\n     connecting apparatus
        40, or alternatively on the mobile machinery. The\n     power receptacle can
        receive hydraulic fluid or electrical power such as\n     DC or AC power.
        For hydraulic or electrically powered devices for driving\n     the second
        framework of the first connecting apparatus 40, such as a\n     hydraulic
        or electrically powered cylinder, or for locally pumped fluid,\n     a power
        receptacle can be provided on the mobile machinery. The power\n     receptacle
        can receive power such as hydraulic fluid or DC or AC power.\n<BR><BR>[0373]
        Each wing section 221 slidably-mounted frame 46 is mounted in an\n     offset
        position on the wing section rigidly-mounted base frame 45 to\n     allow
        for the implements attached to the wing section 221 to extend past\n     the
        outer edge of the wing section 221, thereby allowing for the\n     implements
        attached to the first connecting apparatus 40 to extend\n     partially across
        and into the horizontal plane of the wing section 221.\n     This allows for
        a cultivating or other farm work path of approximately\n     sixty feet in
        width when utilizing three independently moving twenty feet\n     wide implements.
        The outer wing section 221 sliding frames 46 move\n     independently of each
        other and independently of the first connecting\n     apparatus 40 sliding
        frame 46. This independent motion of the sliding\n     frames allows for a
        farmer to till, bed-shape and plant crop sections of\n     the farmland in
        twenty-foot wide sections using the first connecting\n     apparatus 40 with
        attached implements and then mount the lighter weight\n     wing sections
        221 to the first connecting apparatus 40 for the use of\n     lighter weight
        implements that can traverse two additional twenty-feet\n     wide crop sections
        for less strenuous implement activities such as\n     weeding, spraying and
        harvesting. The independent motion of the wing\n     section 221 sliding frames
        46 allows the wing section 221 sliding frame\n     46 to follow their own
        particular section of the crop rows as that\n     particular section of crop
        rows was planted by a guidance system\n     independently of the other crop
        row sections in the sixty-foot total area\n     covered, variances between
        the twenty-foot sections of crops rows\n     throughout the farm occur. Conversely,
        if a sixty-foot continuous\n     implement is attached to the first connecting
        apparatus 40 sliding-frame\n     46 with no independently controlled wing
        sections attached and traversing\n     three twenty foot sections of crop
        rows and the twenty-foot sections of\n     crop rows as shaped and planted
        independently of each other as many\n     farmers practice currently, the
        sixty-foot continuous implement may not\n     align properly with all of the
        planted crop rows resulting in damaged\n     crops in a farming procedure
        such as weeding.\n<BR><BR>[0374] Functionality of the Related Parts of the
        Connecting Apparatus:\n<BR><BR>[0375] The receiver 110 or 110e provides the
        present position of the\n     slidable-frame 46 to a GPS controller or laser
        beam fixedly located in\n     the field. The GPS controller or laser beam
        contains the coordinates\n     describing the desired field position of the
        implement attached to the\n     slidable-frame 46 at any one time. If the
        slidable-frame 46 and the\n     implement being carried are out of position,
        the GPS signal or laser\n     beams signal, after being received by the receiver-110
        or 110e, directs\n     the driver controller 150 to position the driver 80
        to keep the implement\n     which is attached to the connecting apparatus
        on the prescribed path\n     using the hydraulic controls on the tractor the
        apparatus 40. The piston\n     of the hydraulic cylinder 80 moves the slidable-frame
        46 laterally to the\n     desired position as the tractor moves along.\n<BR><BR>[0376]
        A GPS controller is typically a microprocessor that receives GPS\n     signals,
        compare the received signal to preprogrammed desired\n     coordinates, and
        outputs a signal based on the difference, if any,\n     between the desired
        coordinates and the received position. Such GPS\n     controllers are conventionally
        used for controlling tractor steering. A\n     conventional GPS guided steering
        system for tractors is available from\n     Trimble of Sunnyvale, Calif. One
        popular GPS guidance system currently\n     being used in the agricultural
        industry is called Real-Time Kinematic\n     (RTK). RTK systems when combined
        with earth mounted base stations using\n     radio or cellular signals relayed
        to the roving mobile machinery within a\n     prescribed radius location can
        achieve horizontal accuracy of &lt;4\n     centimeters in most conditions.
        Laser guidance and wire signal guidance\n     are also viable guidance system
        technologies available for the control of\n     the present invention apparatuses.
        A laser guidance system normally uses\n     a vertical spinning laser transmitter
        to be received by the laser\n     receiver mounted on the apparatus top bar
        100a or 100b. The laser\n     receiver 110 then transmits a signal to the
        controller 150 which then\n     controls the driver 80 and the position of
        the sliding frame 46 of the\n     controlled apparatus 40. A wire signal guidance
        system involves multiple\n     sensors mounted on a bottom bar for a buried
        wire and on the top bar for\n     overhead wires. The bottom bar 140 sensor
        mounted system normally is\n     utilized in open field agriculture while
        the top bar 100b mounted sensors\n     system normally is utilized in greenhouse
        agricultural applications.\n<BR><BR>[0377] The lateral position of the sliding
        frame with respect to the\n     center line of the base frame and forward
        movement of the tractor can be\n     adjusted by causing the pistons of the
        hydraulic cylinder 32 to extend or\n     retract.\n<BR><BR>[0378] The control
        of the hydraulic cylinder 80 can be implemented in\n     manual mode by the
        driver, a second individual, or automatically in\n     automatic mode by a
        controller including sensors monitoring the position\n     of the three-point
        hitch attached implement with respect to a known\n     desired position for
        the implement.\n<BR><BR>[0379] A system according to this invention comprises
        the mobile machinery\n     such as a tractor having a three-point hitch, the
        connecting apparatus\n     attached to the mobile machinery with the three
        attachments; and an\n     implement attached to the slidable second framework
        with at least three\n     connectors. To connect the apparatus to the implement,
        the implement and\n     apparatus are placed proximate to each other; the
        alignment of the\n     connectors and the hitches are determined, and the
        alignment is adjusted\n     by sliding the second framework relative to the
        first framework.\n<BR><BR>[0380] After attachment of the implement to the
        connecting apparatus is\n     completed, during use of the system, the position
        of the implement\n     relative to the mobile machinery is adjusted by the
        mobile machinery\n     operator in manual mode or by the signal receiver 110
        or 110e and the\n     driver controller 150 in automatic mode, changing the
        position of the\n     second framework to keep the implement on track.\n<BR><BR>[0381]
        The driver 80 can be powered hydraulically or electrically. FIG. 4a\n     is
        a flow chart depicting a hydraulic driver and related components\n     suitable
        for use with the present invention. It utilizes mobile machinery\n     hydraulic
        pump 81, which is normally used for controlling the three-point\n     hitch
        link arms 318 and 324 (see FIG. 3) and utilizes a fluid reservoir.\n     A
        guidance signal is received by the receiver 110 or 110e which is\n     connected
        to the driver controller 150. The antenna (not shown) is\n     optionally
        provided to enhance the reception of the guidance signal to\n     the GPS
        receiver 110e, but not requires for a laser receiver 110. The\n     driver
        controller 150 transmits a signal to the automatic double action\n     hydraulic
        valve 238 to control the driver 80. If the hydraulic valve\n     option switch
        240 is in the automatic position, the automatic double\n     action hydraulic
        valve 238 controls the driver 80. If the hydraulic valve\n     option switch
        240 is in the manual position, the automatic double action\n     hydraulic
        valve 238 does not receive hydraulic fluid and is not\n     operational, and
        thus the manual double action hydraulic valve 236\n     controls the driver
        at the tractor operator's initiation. Hydraulic power\n     receptacles 242
        provide connect and disconnect locations for the\n     hydraulic lines leading
        from the hydraulic fluid valves to the driver 80\n     for connection and
        removal of the apparatus from the three point hitch of\n     the mobile machinery.\n<BR><BR>[0382]
        Electrical power from the mobile machinery battery is used for\n     powering
        the drive controller 150 and signal receiver 110 or 110e.\n<BR><BR>[0383]
        FIG. 4b is a flow chart depicting an electric driver and related\n     components
        of the present invention apparatuses. As in the hydraulic\n     version, a
        guidance signal is received by the receiver 110 or 110e which\n     then transmits
        the signal to the driver controller 150. The driver\n     controller 150 sends
        a signal to an automatic electric switch 248 to\n     control the driver 80.
        If an electric option switch 250 is in the\n     automatic position, the automatic
        electric switch 248 controls the driver\n     80. If the electric option switch
        250 is in the manual position, the\n     automatic electric switch 248 does
        not receive electric current and is\n     not operational, therefore allowing
        the manual electric switch 246 to\n     control the driver at the tractor
        operator's initiation. Electric power\n     receptacles 244 provide connect
        and disconnect locations for the\n     electrical conductors leading from
        the electric switches to the driver 80\n     for the connection and removal
        of the present invention apparatuses from\n     the three point hitch of the
        tractor.\n<BR><BR>[0384] A typical method of using the invention for agricultural
        comprises:\n<BR><BR>[0385] 1. Choose a guidance system:   [0386] a. Manual
        or automatic.\n     [0387] b. If manual, choose single tractor operator or
        double tractor\n     operator. (Double operator--first operator steering the
        tractor and the\n     second operator manually controlling the apparatus driver
        80). [0388] c.\n     If automatic, choose GPS guided, laser guided, guidance
        wire guided or\n     other. [0389] d. If automatic is chosen, the guidance
        system must be set\n     up and installed.\n<BR><BR>[0390] 2. Row and raised
        bed crops utilizing the guided system with all\n     steps for any or all
        of the following:   [0391] a. Precision tilling or\n     preparing the soil
        for planting. [0392] b. Precision position spraying of\n     herbicides and/or
        insecticides prior to planting if required. [0393] c.\n     Precision laying
        or dropping fertilizer if required. [0394] d. Precision\n     position installing
        drip tape if required. [0395] e. Precision position\n     installing of mulch
        or plastic culture if required. [0396] f. Precision\n     position planting
        of seeds or transplanting seedlings. [0397] g.\n     Precision position spraying
        of herbicides and/or insecticides after\n     planting if required. [0398]
        h. Precision position weeding with soil\n     cultivation or weed cutting
        when required. [0399] i. Precision position\n     harvesting.\n<BR><BR>[0400]
        The invention can also be used for earth excavating and grading.\n<BR><BR>[0401]
        Among the advantages of the invention with a guided system are:\n     [0402]
        a) The horizontal adjustments of the present invention provide an\n     accurate
        system of obtaining the desired path of excavation and soil\n     preparation
        as compared to utilizing an automated steering device of the\n     mobile
        machinery as the only form of implement path guidance. [0403] b)\n     Utilizing
        mobile machinery steering guidance combined with mobile\n     machinery implement
        guidance creates a more accurate system of obtaining\n     the desired path
        of excavation and soil preparation as compared to\n     utilizing an automated
        steering device of the mobile machinery as the\n     only form of implement
        path guidance.\n<BR><BR>Example of Construction of Materials\n<BR><BR>[0404]
        The following are exemplary materials that can be used for the\n     claimed

        primarily for clearness\n     of understanding and no unnecessary limitations
        are to be understood\n     therefrom, for modification will become obvious
        to those skilled in the\n     art upon reading this disclosure and may be
        made without departing from\n     the spirit of the invention and scope of
        the appended claims. For\n     example, the invention has been principally
        described using a tractor as\n     the mobile machinery. However the invention
        can be used with other\n     machinery such as truck, plow, or excavating
        machinery. In addition,\n     although the invention has been described principally
        with regard to\n     hydraulic cylinders, electric cylinders can be used.
        Instead of a sleeve\n     for the second framework to slide along the rails,
        the rails can be\n     provided with a bracket, track, or other structure
        which can be engaged\n     by the second framework such as a projection on
        lateral cross members.\n     Accordingly, this invention is not intended to
        be limited by the specific\n     exemplification presented herein above. Rather,
        what is intended to be\n     covered is within the spirit and scope of the
