        may be enhanced by recording a visitor's intent and\n     recording page rankings
        that indicate how well the pages of a website\n     match the visitor's intent.
        Using historical intent data, an intent can\n     be inferred for a visitor
        based on a URL. Page recommendations can also\n     be made once a visitor
        has confirmed their intent by determining a ranked\n     list of URLs for
        the indicated intent. Intent data may be collected and\n     displayed by
        integrating an intent widget into webpages of a website.\n</p>\n       <HR>\n<TABLE

        <HR> <BR><BR>What is claimed is: <BR><BR> 1.  A method for predicting an intent
        of a visitor to a webpage, the method comprising: receiving into an intent
        engine at least one input parameter from a web browser\ndisplaying the webpage;
        \ processing the at least one input parameter in the intent engine to determine
        at least one inferred intent;  providing the at least one inferred intent
        to the web browser to cause the at least one inferred intent to be displayed\non
        the webpage;  prompting the visitor to confirm the visitor's intent;  receiving
        a confirmed intent into the intent engine;  processing the confirmed intent
        in the intent engine to determine at least one recommended webpage that matches
        the confirmed\nintent, the at least one recommended webpage selected from
        a plurality of webpages within a defined namespace;  causing the webpage in
        the web browser to display at least one link to the at least one recommended
        webpage;  prompting the visitor to rank\nthe webpage for the inferred intent;
        \ receiving a rank from the web browser;  and storing a datapoint comprising
        an identity of the webpage, the inferred intent and the received rank.\n<BR><BR>
        2.  The method according to claim 1 wherein the at least one input parameter
        comprises an identity of the webpage.\n<BR><BR> 3.  The method according to

        a ranked list of intents for the webpage.\n<BR><BR> 4.  The method according
        to claim 3 comprising: selecting the highest ranked intent for the webpage;
        \ and causing at least the highest ranked intent to be displayed on the webpage
        in the web browser.\n<BR><BR> 5.  A method for predicting a navigation destination
        for a visitor of a webpage belonging to a defined namespace comprising a plurality
        of webpages, the method comprising: prompting the visitor to indicate an intent
        on a webpage displayed at a\nbrowser of the visitor;  receiving the indicated
        intent from the browser into an intent engine;  processing the indicated intent
        in the intent engine to determine one or more recommended webpages of the
        plurality of webpages;  and causing one or more\nlinks to the one or more
        recommended webpages to be displayed in the webpage at the browser;  wherein
        processing the indicated intent comprises using the indicated intent as a
        reference to intent ranking data that ranks the plurality of webpages for
        the\nindicated intent, the intent ranking data comprising intent data provided
        by previous visitors to one or more webpages of the namespace.\n<BR><BR> 6.
        \ The method according to claim 5 wherein processing the intent comprises
        determining a ranked list of webpages of the namespace for the indicated intent.\n<BR><BR>
        7.  The method according to claim 6 wherein determining the ranked list comprises
        processing a plurality of datapoints, each datapoint comprising: an identity
        of a webpage of the namespace;  an intent;  and a ranking of the intent for
        the\nrespective webpage.\n<BR><BR> 8.  The method according to claim 5 wherein
        prompting the user to indicate an intent comprises: inferring at least one
        intent from an identity of the webpage displayed in the browser;  and causing
        the at least one inferred intent to be displayed\non the webpage displayed
        in the browser.\n<BR><BR> 9.  The method according to claim 5 comprising:

        <HR> <BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR> This disclosure relates to systems
        and methods for processing information from visitors to one or more websites.\n<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
        OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR> Websites have become valuable resources for companies
        to engage consumers and customers.  Paramount to the success of a website
        is that visitors to the website can readily identify and navigate to the pages
        within the website that contain the\ninformation or perform the functions
        that correspond to the visitor's intent.\n<BR><BR> What is required are improved
        systems and methods for determining a visitor's intent and for using the visitor's
        intent to predict and suggest webpages for the visitor.\n<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF
        THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR> In one aspect of the disclosure, there is provided
        a method for predicting an intent of a visitor to a webpage.  The method comprises
        receiving into an intent engine at least one input parameter from a web browser
        displaying the webpage.  The\ninput parameter is processed by the intent engine
        to determine at least one inferred intent.  The inferred intent can be sent
        to the visitor's web browser that is displaying the webpage so that the inferred
        intent is displayed to the visitor.\n<BR><BR> In one aspect of the disclosure,
        there is provided a method for predicting a navigation destination for a visitor
        of a webpage belonging to a defined namespace comprising a plurality of webpages.
        \ The method comprises prompting the visitor to\nindicate an intent on a webpage
        displayed at a browser of the visitor.  The indicated intent is received into
        an intent engine for processing.  Processing of the indicated intent comprises
        using the indicated intent as a reference to intent ranking data\nthat ranks
        the plurality of webpages for the indicated intent.  The intent ranking data
        may have been provided by previous visitors to one or more webpages of the
        namespace.  The processing of the indicated intent determines one or more
        recommended\nwebpages defined to be within the namespace that most match the
        indicated intent.  Links to the recommended webpages can be displayed in the
        visitor's browser.\n<BR><BR> In one aspect of the disclosure, there is provided
        an intent processing system comprising an intent engine and at least one database
        configured to store intent data.  The intent engine may be configured to display
        an intent tool in at least one\nwebpage when the at least one webpage is loaded
        into a user browser.  The intent tool may comprise a plurality of display
        elements including one or more of an intent field, a recommendation field,
        and a ranking tool.  The intent engine may also be\nconfigured to display
        at least one intent in the intent field, display at least one webpage recommendation
        in the recommendation field, and receive ranking data from the ranking tool
        and store the ranking data in the at least one database. <BR><BR>BRIEF\nDESCRIPTION

        DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR> A website is generally formed of a
        plurality of distinct Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), each corresponding
        to a page of content.  Each webpage of the website may represent different
        subject matter or a different function of the website, for\nexample, separate
        webpages may be provided for ordering and purchases, order tracking, general
        information, etc.\n<BR><BR> When users visit a website, they are typically
        visiting for a particular purpose.  By knowing the intent of their visit,
        that visitor can be more dynamically directed to the page within the website
        or namespace that best provides the information\nthat the visitor is seeking.\n<BR><BR>
        Research and studies by the present inventors of online experiences have revealed
        the value of measuring and managing the interdependence of site visitor intent
        and success.\n<BR><BR> As visitors navigate the website, their intent information
        can be collected.  The visitors may also be prompted to indicate how well
        the webpages they visit within the website match their intent.  This information
        can then be analyzed to make\nrecommendations to direct subsequent users to
        the most appropriate content on the website for the indicated intents.\n<BR><BR>
        A system for collecting, analyzing and using intent data is illustrated in
        FIG. 1.  The system includes a web server 12 that provides web pages 13 to
        a user at a web browser 14.  Web pages are uploaded to the web server 12 from
        various web page\nadministrators 16.  Typically, an administrator will represent
        a business or the like who has responsibility for the content of a website
        that includes multiple web pages within a website.  Multiple websites, each
        containing multiple webpages, may be\nowned and/or administered by a single
        entity.  For example, a company may have separate websites for different geographic
        locations, or a company may have distinct sub-companies or divisions.  For
        the purposes of the present description, the term\n\"namespace\" will be used
        to cover all webpages under the control of an administrator and will include
        webpages within a single website or within multiple websites.  Thus, the web
        page administrator 16 will be referred to herein as a namespace\nadministrator.\n<BR><BR>
        The system further includes an intent engine 20 that collects and analyzes
        intent data from visitors as they browse webpages within a namespace.  In
        one embodiment, the intent engine 20 provides an intent tool 22 that is used
        in conjunction with\none or more webpages 13 within a namespace.  The intent
        tool 22 may incorporate user interface display elements into a webpage that
        elicit intent and success information from users.  The intent tool provides
        the collected information to the intent engine\n20.  The intent engine 20
        process the intent and success information and learns to predict intent and
        intent-based destination pages.\n<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the intent engine
        20 learns from users' stated visit intent and intent based page ratings to
        provide predictive intent and predictive destination services via a compact
        and interactive web site widget.  This tool fills a gap\nbetween traditional
        site navigation, faceted navigation, search, and social feedback programs
        to provide a unique, hybrid navigation and feedback tool that improves intent-based
        conversion metrics.\n<BR><BR> The intent engine 20 may be implemented on various
        platforms, such as .NET, or cloud based infrastructures such as Google App
        Engine (GAE), Microsoft Azure, Amazon EC2, Rackspace Cloud etc. Other implementations
        will be apparent to a person\nskilled in the art.\n<BR><BR> The intent tool
        will be described herein as a third party service offering made to owners
        and administrators of websites and namespaces.  However, other implementations,
        such as direct installations by the website administrators will be apparent\nto
        a person skilled in the art.  Similarly, the intent engine 20 will be described
        herein as remote from the web server 12.  In various alternative embodiments,
        the intent engine may be incorporated into a web server and/or within a website
        of an\norganization.  That is, intent data may be collected, analyzed and
        used directly by the web server and/or directly by the website owner.\n<BR><BR>
        The Intent engine 20 may control multiple namespaces for different customers
        and may be administered by an intent engine administrator 18.  The intent
        engine 20 may be operatively associated with an intent database 23 for storing
        various intent\nrelated data, such as page views, intent candidates, recommendations
        for particular web pages, success data, etc., as will be described in greater
        detail below.  Data within the intent database 23 may be grouped by namespace,
        so that a particular\nnamespace administrator may only access data relevant
        to their account.\n<BR><BR> In FIG. 2, there is shown a flowchart 100 for
        predicting the intent of a visitor to a webpage of a defined namespace.  At
        step 101, the intent engine 20 receives input parameters, such as a URL or
        similar webpage identity from the web browser of\na visitor.  The intent engine
        processes the input parameters (step 102), for example by referencing historical
        intent data, to infer one or more intents of the visitor.  At step 103, the
        inferred intents are provided to the web browser for display to the\nvisitor.\n<BR><BR>
        A method for predicting a navigation destination for the visitor is depicted
        in the flowchart 200 of FIG. 3.  At step 201, the visitor is prompted to indicate
        an intent.  The indicated intent is received into the intent engine (step
        202) and\nprocessed to determine on or more web page recommendations (step
        203).  The intent engine may use the indicated intent to reference to historical
        intent data provided by previous visitors to the webpages of the namespace.
        \ The web page recommendations\nmay be provided to the visitor web browser
        (step 204) for display to the visitor, e.g. as hyperlinks to the recommended
        web pages.\n<BR><BR> In one embodiment, intent and success data may be recorded
        as a series of data points or page views.  Each page view may associate the
        URL of the viewed page, a current intent indicated in a display element and
        a success rating provided by the\nuser that indicates how well the viewed
        webpage matches the current intent.  An Intent Ranking Formula, described
        in more detail below, may be applied to the collective Page View data provided
        by multiple visitors to calculate intent rankings for\nwebpages within the
        namespace.\n<BR><BR> The ranking process may be a two-way process.  That is,
        each URL within the namespace may be associated with a ranked list of intents.
        \ Such lists may be used for inferring intents when a visitor navigates to
        that particular webpage.  If the\nvisitor confirms the intent, the visitor
        may be provided with a list of recommended webpages that also show a strong
        match to the confirmed intent.\n<BR><BR> The corollary of the intent ranking
        is that each Intent may be associated with a ranked list of URLs.  The list
        of URLs may be used to make the recommendations when a visitor has confirmed
        their intent.\n<BR><BR> As described above, the intent tool 22 displays intent
        elements within each webpage of a namespace.  The display elements may include
        an intent indicator, a page recommendation and a rating indicator.  The display
        elements may be provided as a\nconfigurable widget 22 that includes coded
        instructions to reference the intent engine 20 and databases 23 in response
        to navigation events within the user browser 14.  The individual components
        of the intent tool 22 may be incorporated into the website\nas a configurable
        widget.\n<BR><BR> Intent Management\n<BR><BR> For consistency and clarity,
        the following terminology will be used to described the intent based tools
        and methodologies.  However, the terminology is provided by way of example
        only and is not intended to limit the application and scope of the\ninvention.\n<BR><BR>
        Intent--a unique purpose or usage of the website.\n<BR><BR> Intent Candidates--a
        ranked list of Intents for the current page.\n<BR><BR> Inferred Intent--one
        or more of the highest ranked Intent Candidates for the current page.  The
        intent tool passively applies the Inferred Intent to each page by default.\n<BR><BR>
        Declared Intent--an Intent that has been confirmed by the visitor as the purpose
        for the page visit.\n<BR><BR> Current Intent--the current user-specified or
        programmatically inferred Intent for the page visit.  The Inferred Intent
        (top rated) is applied as the Current Intent until the user sets a Declared
        Intent.\n<BR><BR> Account--the website vender.\n<BR><BR> Account NameSpace--collection
        of domains and web pages for the website vender.\n<BR><BR> Current Page--the
        currently rendered Page within a web browser.\n<BR><BR> Destination Candidates--the
        ranked list of possible next pages for the Current Page and the Current Intent.\n<BR><BR>
        Page--a distinct URL of the NameSpace.\n<BR><BR> Success--a `thumbs-up` rating
        of a page.  The highest point value available.\n<BR><BR> Visitor--users of
        the vender/customer's website.\n<BR><BR> The intent engine 20 can be used
        to integrate a widget 22 into a webpage 13 of a website that allows a user
        to perform intent based navigation of the website.  When a visitor 14 visits
        a web site, a web page 13 including the widget 22 is\ndisplayed in the web
        browser 14 of the visitor.\n<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the intent widget
        22 appears as an unobtrusive but always available \"toolbar\" on the customer's
        website.  It will be embedded in the page as an integral part of the site.
        \ An example of the intent widget is depicted in FIG. 4. It provides features
        for a Current Intent 31, which may be an inferred intent or an intent confirmed
        by the visitor, as well as Destination recommendations 32, and a Page Rating
        33.\n<BR><BR> When a visitor first navigates to a webpage within a namespace
        controlled by the intent engine, the intent engine 20 infers an intent of
        the visitor.  In one embodiment, the URL of the current page is provided to
        the intent engine, which uses\nthe URL as a lookup to the database 23.  The
        URL reference returns a ranked list of intent candidates and the intent engine
        selects the highest ranked intent for that URL as the inferred intent.  The
        inferred intent is displayed in a current intent field\nin the intent display
        of the webpage 13.  The inferred intent may be continuously updated as the
        visitor navigates to other webpages within the namespace.  The visitor may
        click a drop-down/pop-up 35 that displays the ranked list of other Intent\nCandidates
        for the current URL.  Additionally, the visitor may type their own Intent
        into the intent tool.  During text entry, the intent engine 20 may attempt
        to display auto-complete suggestions to help the visitor identify known reasons
        for visiting\nthe website.\n<BR><BR> Because an inferred intent is the highest
        rated intent for a particular webpage, displaying the inferred intent can
        provide a quick indication to a visitor of the most relevant subject matter
        on that webpage.  If the inferred intent does not\nmatch the visitor's actual
        intent, then the visitor may use the intent widget to indicate a more accurate
        intent and then select the recommended page that most matches their indicated
        intent.\n<BR><BR> Once the visitor has selected/declared their intent, the
        indicated intent becomes the Current Intent and the intent engine 20 stops
        predicting intents as the user browses the site.\n<BR><BR> The intent engine
        20 also displays a continuously updated Destination Candidate 32 based upon
        the Current Intent 31.  The Destination Candidate 32 may be determined by
        providing the Current Intent as a reference to the database 23 to retrieve
        a\nranked list of URLs for that intent.  In one embodiment, the Destination
        Candidate may be selected as the highest ranked URL of the Destination Candidate
        list.  In one embodiment, the navigation history of the user may also be incorporated
        into the\nselection process so that if the visitor has already visited the
        highest ranked webpage for the Current Intent, then the Destination Candidate
        may be selected as the next highest candidate in the destination list, or
        the next highest and non-visited\ndestination candidate.\n<BR><BR> By clicking
        the Destination Candidate 32, the visitor's browser is immediately navigated
        to the destination page.  Alternatively, the visitor may click to view a drop-down/pop-up
        list 36 of other ranked Destination Candidates.  In one\nembodiment, the Destination
        Candidate may be displayed only once a user has confirmed their intent.\n<BR><BR>
        Users may jump directly to one of the suggested pages and users may rate the
        current page in respect to the visit intent.  Page ratings may be made via
        various rating systems including a simple thumbs-up/thumbs-down action to
        indicate success or\nfailure as well as more granular 1-to-5 star ratings
        of the page's value.  Whenever the visitor makes a rating, the rating data
        is added to other ratings data and used to generate subsequent intent rankings.\n<BR><BR>
        The system thus provides a dynamic, self-learning and self-populating navigation
        assistance tool that aids a visitor to a website to find the information that
        they are seeking.\n<BR><BR> Consider an Inferred Intent that has not been
        confirmed by a visitor as the visitor's intent.  The visitor may still indicate
        how well the webpage content matches the inferred intent.  If the rating is
        poor, then this poor rating will affect\nfuture inferred intent calculations,
        making it less likely that that particular intent will be an inferred intent
        for that particular page for subsequent visitors.  Consequently, an alternative
        and potentially more relevant intent will be inferred for\nthat webpage which
        may receive more favorable visitor ratings.\n<BR><BR> Consider now a Confirmed
        Intent.  When the visitor first confirms their intent, they are presented
        with recommended links to the pages that are rated most highly for that intent.
        \ If the visitor navigates to a recommended page but is of the\nopinion that
        the page content does not match the visitor's intent, then the visitor may
        rate the page poorly.  When the same situation occurs for a subsequent visitor,
        i.e. same intent, the updated intent rating statistics may cause an alternative
        (and\npotentially more relevant) page to be the most highly ranked page for
        the confirmed intent, and so the subsequent visitor will be recommended to
        the alternative page.\n<BR><BR> User indicated rankings provide a direct method
        for ranking a webpage.  However, other more passive methods may also be incorporated
        as alternatives or in addition to the user rankings.  For example, in the
        absence of a specific rating,\nnavigating away from a webpage without performing
        any action on the webpage may be used to infer that the content did not match
        the visitor intent.  Performing an action on the webpage, reading to the bottom
        of a screen, or lingering on the webpage, may\nbe used to infer that the content
        of the webpage matches the visitor's intent.  All of these could be used to
        determine if the page was successful but user rankings may be given the highest
        priority.\n<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the configuration tool may also show
        a historical ranking of the intent for the webpage.  The historical ranking
        may be an average ranking, a weighted average ranking, a last ranking, or
        some other ranking.\n<BR><BR> In the example of FIG. 4, the widget 22 is shown
        incorporated into a webpage for Dell Computers.  The widget 22 includes a
        current intent 31 as \"D820 RAM upgrade\".  A user may alter the current intent
        by selecting other intents from a drop down\nmenu 35 or by typing text directly
        into the current intent field 31.  Based on the current intent, the widget
        22 displays a recommendation 32 that provides a hyperlink to a webpage within
        the namespace that is most likely to provide the information that\nthe visitor
        is seeking, i.e. that matches the current intent.  While the highest recommendation
        is automatically shown by the widget 22 in the recommendation field 32, other
        recommendations may be viewed and selected from a drop down menu 36.  In the\npresent
        example, the visitor is recommended to a page that is dedicated to \"DELL
        Latitude D820 RAM Upgrades\".\n<BR><BR> At any stage, the visitor may select
        the rating tool 33 to indicate a rating of the webpage for the current intent,
        whether or not the visitor has confirmed the current intent 31 and whether
        or not the visitor has followed a link in the\nrecommendation field 32.  As
        shown in FIG. 4, the rating tool includes a scale for the visitor to rate
        the current page against the Current Intent.  In one embodiment, a 7-point
        scale is provided using which the visitor may rate pages via a simple\nthumbs-up
        and thumbs-down to indicate Success (6) or Failure (0), or they may choose
        to give the page 1 to 5 stars to indicate degrees of Success.  Other rating
        systems such as a score out of 10, position on a slide bar, selection of a
        category (e.g.\nhighly relevant, moderately relevant, not relevant, etc) will
        be apparent to a person skilled in the art and particular rating systems are
        not intended to be limiting.\n<BR><BR> The visitor does not have to fully
        understand the \"Success\" paradigm or the nature of the 7-point scale.  They
        may simply interact with familiar concepts, thumbs-up/down and a range of
        stars, as they see fit.\n<BR><BR> The intent widget 22 shown in FIG. 4 is
        one example configuration and a person skilled in the art will recognize that
        multiple configurations are possible.  FIG. 5 shows an alternative configuration
        in which the widget 22 is displayed in a\nvertical configuration, with equivalent
        fields for current intent 31, recommendation 32 and rating tool 33 as shown
        for the horizontal implementation 22.  In alternative configurations, each
        of the intent display elements may be provided at separate\nlocations within
        a rendering of the webpage.  Some of the intent display elements may also
        be hidden within the page until activated or required by the visitor.  For
        example, the recommendation field may be hidden until the visitor confirms
        their intent.\n<BR><BR> The widget may be configurable to allow variations
        to size, position, display order of elements, collapsibility, etc. In addition,
        the tool may be skin-able to present a company logo and/or a background that
        reflects the website vender's 16 own\nbranding.\n<BR><BR> Other display options
        are possible for the widget.  In alternative embodiments, the intent tool
        may be presented as a floating toolbar that scrolls with the page, or as a
        widget that is collapsible to a small, floating intent tool indicator. \nThe
        intent tool may also be provided as an optional browser extension that is
        used instead if the user has them installed.  While the examples show single
        intents and single recommendations, the display of the widget may be altered
        so that multiple\nintents and/or multiple recommendations are shown at any
        one time.\n<BR><BR> A process for loading the intent widget will now be described
        with reference to FIG. 1 and the flowchart 300 of FIG. 6.  At step 301, the
        webpage begins to load in the visitor's browser, e.g. in response to a page
        request from the visitor 14. \nThe loading of the web page triggers the execution
        of the intent tool script (step 302).  A pageLoad event fires at step 303
        causing an Initialize Page request to be sent to the intent engine 20.  In
        these steps, the Intent Engine matches the current URL\nto the list of Predicted
        Intents and links to recommended pages associated to the current URL.  The
        predictive intents and recommended pages are transmitted to the browser for
        display in the widget.\n<BR><BR> At step 305, the intent engine 20 ascertains
        whether the URL is a valid URL within the namespace of a website governed
        by the intent engine 20.  If the URL is invalid, the process stops (step 306).
        \ If the URL is valid, the intent engine then\noptionally determines whether
        the Visitor is defined (step 307).  If the Visitor is not defined in the intent
        engine, then a new Visitor ID may be created (step 308).  The process then
        proceeds to calculate a top intent list (step 309).  The top intent\nlist
        may be determined using the URL, a Visitor ID, or other parameter as a lookup
        to the intent data of the intent database 23.\n<BR><BR> The process 300 then
        determines whether the visitor has confirmed or declared an intent (step 310).
        \ If the intent has been declared, the declared intent and namespace is used
        as a lookup to the database 23 to determine one or more recommended\nURL destinations
        within the namespace that match the declared intent (step 311).  If no intent
        has been declared, the top intent is used as the lookup reference instead
        (step 312) to generate the recommended URL destinations.  At step 313, the
        intent and\ndestination lists are returned by the intent engine to the web
        server 12 to be incorporated in the widget 22 displayed in the web page 13
        provided to the user browser 14.\n<BR><BR> A state diagram 400, illustrated
        in FIG. 7, shows states of the widget within a website as a visitor navigates
        their way around the website.  After starting 401, the widget displays the
        top rated intent and destination data 402.  After a\npageload event, the widget
        waits for inferred or predicted intent data and recommendations from the intent
        engine for the URL to which the user has navigated 403.  After receiving the
        intent data, the widget displays the predicted recommendations 404\nbased
        on inferred intents.  The widget then prompts or awaits feedback from the
        visitor to rate the URL for the indicated intent 405.  Rating feedback for
        an indicated intent is recorded in the database 23 and used to prepare future
        intent ratings and\nrecommendations.  Visitor feedback may include page ratings
        and intent selections as well as selection of recommendations.  If the feedback
        from the visitor includes a confirmation or indication of the visitor's intent,
        then the widget state moves to\ndisplaying predications based upon the confirmed
        intent 406.  The widget state returns to feedback prompting 405 in which the
        same feedback actions, including recording page ratings, can be made as previously,
        though now based upon the confirmed intent. \nIf the user navigates to another
        URL within the namespace, the widget waits for a pageload of the new URL 407,
        and then waits for intent data from the intent engine 20 for the new URL 408.
        \ The widget then returns to the state 406 in which\nrecommendations for the
        confirmed intent are displayed.\n<BR><BR> A high level data flow diagram will
        now be described with reference to FIG. 8.  When an administrator of a website
        or namespace that includes multiple pages embarks on an installation and configuration
        process 71 of the intent widget 22,\ncustomer source files are provided from
        a source file database 72 of the intent engine.  When a web page is requested
        from a user browser 74, the web page files, such as HTML and JavaScript files
        are provided to the Load Web Page process 75.  The process\n75 executes the
        intent widget script which causes an \"Init Page\" request 76 to be sent to
        an initialize view process that executes in the intent engine.  The initialize
        view process 77 retrieves namespace data from a customer database 68 in order
        to\nvalidate that the requested page is part of a namespace controlled by
        the intent engine and to ascertain any rules that are dependent on that namespace.
        \ Assuming authentication, intent variables are then retrieved from an intent
        candidate cache 78, and\nranking data from a page intent ranking data store
        79.\n<BR><BR> The intent candidate data and page intent ranking data is returned
        to the load web page process 75 for rendering the web page, including the
        intent widget, to the user's browser 75.  For statistical recording, the page
        for which intent data was\nrequested may be recorded to a page view datastore
        69.\n<BR><BR> Each of the datastores illustrated in FIG. 8 may be provided
        as components of the database 23 of FIG. 1.\n<BR><BR> Dataflows during the
        \"Init Page\" process are shown in more detail in FIG. 9.  Within the user's
        browser 74, a request 81 is provided to the intent engine to trigger an authorization
        process 82 within the intent engine.  The intent engine\nreceives a customer
        ID or URL from a session cookie 83 of the user browser 74 and uses this information
        as a lookup to the customer/namespace database 68 to confirm that the URL
        is within a valid namespace of the intent engine.  If the authorization\nproceeds,
        the authorization process 82 passes the Customer ID to an Identify User process
        84.  The process 84 receives a visitor ID from the session cookie 83 and passes
        the Visitor ID and the Customer ID to a Record Page View process 85.  If the\nvisitorID
        has not been defined a new visitorID is generated and returned to the session
        cookie.  The Record Page View process includes identifying the page, caching
        the page view and writing the cached page view to the Page Views datastore
        69.  The page\nmay be identified by receiving a Page ID from a pages datastore
        86.  The Record Page View aggregates the Page ID, Visitor ID as well as any
        Intent and Ranking information from the user session 83 and stores this data
        collectively in the Page Views\ndatastore 69.  When a page load happens the
        visited page is associated with the intent and given a default rank.  Thus
        each page load does affect the rank but much less than a user defined ranking.\n<BR><BR>
        The Page and Intent information is then passed to a Create Intent List process
        87.  The page data is used as a lookup to the Intent Candidate Cache to retrieve
        one or more intent candidates.  The process 87 creates an intent list of intent\ncandidates
        which is then passed to a Create Destination List process 88.  The current
        intent and URL are used as a lookup to the Page Rank Matrix 79 to select recommended
        URLs that match the current intent.  The Process 88 creates the destination
        list\nand then passes the intent list and the destination list to user browser
        74 for display in the appropriate fields of the widget.\n<BR><BR> As described
        above, a user may indicate their intent by selecting an inferred intent from
        the intent field of the widget or by entering a new intent into the intent
        field.  The confirmed intent is sent to the session cookie 83 which prevents
        the\nPage Initialization process from generating inferred intent lists each
        time the Visitor navigates to another webpage of the namespace.\n<BR><BR>
        If the intent entered is a new intent for the namespace and/or the particular
        URL, the intent may be entered into an Intents datastore, provided as part
        of the database 23.  When subsequent visitors use the widget, the user-entered
        intent may be\nlisted as an inferred intent, in particular where that intent
        has been rated highly for the URL or namespace.  By allowing users to enter
        and rate their own intents, the intent engine can be provided as a dynamic
        self-learning and self-populating system.\n<BR><BR> Page Rating\n<BR><BR>
        One data point that drives the intent engine is the visitors' rating of pages.
        \ This value drives the calculation of Inferred Intent and Recommended Destination
        pages.\n<BR><BR> Rating Scale\n<BR><BR> Page Ratings may be recorded on a
        7-point (0 to 6) scale with zero indicating Failure and 6 indicating Success.\n<BR><BR>
        TABLE-US-00001 Value Description Thumbs-down 0 Failure 1-Star 1 Not very useful
        2-Stars 2 3-Stars 3 Moderately useful 4-Stars 4 5-Stars 5 Very Useful\n<BR><BR>
        Ratings Data\n<BR><BR> All page ratings are recorded in respect to the visitor's
        Current Intent.  Only one record will be recorded per visitor, per page, per
        intent.  Therefore, if during a single website browsing session the visitor
        rates the same page twice, then\nthe second rating replaces the first rating
        of the page.\n<BR><BR> The Page rank data structure may be depicted as follows:\n<BR><BR>
        TABLE-US-00002 Field Type Notes ID int Identifies a unique visitor-page-rank
        instance PageID int The page VisitorID int The visitor TimeStamp DateTime
        When IntentID int The Intent Rank byte (a small # data type) The ranking\n<BR><BR>
        The dataflows for page ranking are illustrated in FIG. 10.  When a user provides
        a ranking, a rank request 90 is first sent from the user browser 74 to the
        intent engine 20.  The rank request triggers a Moderate Abuse process 91 which
        uses t\nVisitor ID to retrieve a visitor history from an abuse history datastore
        92.  The visitor history is processed to determine whether the visitor has
        a history of spamming or otherwise mis-using the intent engine processes.\n<BR><BR>
        If the abuse history is clear, then the rank request is passed to an authorization
        request process 93.  The authorization process 93 is similar to the process
        82 described above in FIG. 9 and uses the customer ID or URL received from
        the session\ncookie 83 of the browser 74 to ensure that the URL involved is
        within a namespace governed by the intent engine.  Identifying the namespace
        within a customers datastore 68 also allows any namespace specific rules to
        be determined.\n<BR><BR> Once authorized, an Identify Page process 94 is triggered
        which uses the URL provided from the Authorization process 93 to extract a
        page identity from the Pages datastore 86.  A Cache Page View with Rank process
        95 is then performed.  The\ncaching process 95 receives the visitor, intent
        and rank data from the session cookie 83 and the page data from the Identify
        Page process 94.  This data is cached as a PageView in the PageView cache
        while a Queue Write-behind Task 97 is prepared.  When\nthe queue 99 reaches
        the specific cache writing task, a Write Cache to Database task 98 retrieves
        any pageview data from the cache and writes to the Page Views datastore 69.
        \ At the end of the process, the Page Views datastore includes one or more
        page\nviews that each associate a page (URL), an intent and a visitor ranking
        of the intent for the page.\n<BR><BR> The Intent Ranking Formula\n<BR><BR>
        The page/intent/ranking data of the Page Views datastore 69 may be processed
        by the intent engine to periodically calculate ordered lists of ranked Intent
        Candidates and ordered lists of Destination candidates per page per intent.\n<BR><BR>
        The processing of the data may be based on an intent ranking formula that
        may be fixed or may be configurable per namespace account.  Various ranking
        formulas may be used and many standard formulas will be apparent to a person
        skilled in the\nart.  In a simple embodiment, the ranked lists may be generated
        by averaging a ranking of a page/intent combination across all applicable
        page views that include that page/intent combination.  In a more complex formula,
        page view dated may be aged so\nthat more recent data is weighted favorably
        while page view data older than a particular threshold is ignored completely.\n<BR><BR>
        In alternative embodiments, more complex intent ranking formulas may be applied.
        \ In one embodiment, there are three variable types and each variable is calculated
        at the Page and Site scope for a total of 6 variables.  Each variable has
        a value\nbetween 0 and 100 and is then multiplied by an Account specific modifier
        to customize the formula for each Account.\n<BR><BR> Unit Days\n<BR><BR> A
        portion of the Intent Ranking Formula is time sensitive so that more recent
        feedback may be weighted accordingly.  The Unit Days attribute determines
        how quickly the time element ages feedback and it allows the formula to work
        equally well on\nbusy and slow websites.  Essentially, this attribute determines
        how many days of values to group together in each \"bucket\" of aged results.
        \ The default value, 1.0, ages data every day.  Adjusting this value to 2.0,
        for example, ages the data every two\ndays.  While adjusting this value to
        7.0 ages the data every 7 days.\n<BR><BR> Freshness Value\n<BR><BR> The Freshness
        Value uses the Unit Days attribute (above) to reflect how recently a given
        Intent has been used.  With this value, the \"freshness\" of the data exponentially
        effects the Intent ranking, with newer entries valued more than older\nentries.\n<BR><BR>
        Page Freshness\n<BR><BR> Page Freshness is calculated per Intent per Page.
        \ It indicates how recently a given Intent was used for the current page.\n<BR><BR>
        Site Freshness\n<BR><BR> Site Freshness is calculated per Intent for the entire
        site or namespace.  It indicates how recently a given Intent was used anywhere
        on the site.\n<BR><BR> Freshness Modifier\n<BR><BR> For each Freshness calculation,
        page and site, the Account Administrator may adjust a modifier value to increase
        or decrease the affect of Freshness on the Intent Ranking.  Therefore, by
        adjusting the Unit Days attribute and the Freshness\nModifiers the Account
        Administrator has significant control over the time-sensitiveness of the Intent
        Ranking Formula.  The default Freshness Modifier is 1.0.\n<BR><BR> Popularity
        Value\n<BR><BR> The Popularity Value reflects how often a given Intent has
        been used.\n<BR><BR> Page Popularity\n<BR><BR> Page Popularity is calculated
        per Intent per Page.  It indicates how frequently a given Intent was used
        for the current page.\n<BR><BR> Site Popularity\n<BR><BR> Site Popularity
        is calculated per Intent for the entire site or namespace.  It indicates how
        frequently a given Intent was used anywhere on the site.\n<BR><BR> Popularity
        Modifier\n<BR><BR> For each Popularity calculation, page and site, the Account
        Administrator may adjust a modifier value to increase or decrease the affect
        of Popularity on the Intent Ranking.  The default Popularity Modifier is 1.0.\n<BR><BR>
        Effectiveness Value\n<BR><BR> The Effectiveness Value reflects the visitor
        page ratings for a given Intent.  In other words, it indicates how high or
        low visitors rated pages overall when using each Intent.\n<BR><BR> Page Effectiveness\n<BR><BR>
        Page Effectiveness is calculated per Intent per Page.  It indicates how well
        visitors rated the current page per Intent.\n<BR><BR> Site Effectiveness\n<BR><BR>
        Site Effectiveness is calculated per Intent for the entire site or namespace.
        \ It indicates how well visitors rated all pages on the site per Intent.\n<BR><BR>
        Effectiveness Modifier\n<BR><BR> For each Effectiveness calculation, page
        and site, the Account Administrator may adjust a modifier value to increase
        or decrease the affect of Effectiveness on the Intent Ranking.  The default
        Effectiveness Modifier is 1.0.\n<BR><BR> Summary of the Intent Ranking Formula\n<BR><BR>
        It can be seen from the above, that the Intent Ranking Formula may be provided
        in various embodiments as a combination of three types of values (Freshness,
        Popularity, and Effectiveness) measured at two different levels of scope (Per
        Page and\nPer Site) for a total of 6 different variables.  In addition, each
        variable may be modified by a fixed multiplier to increase or decrease the
        importance of each variable for the site.\n<BR><BR> The intent ranking formula
        may applied each time the formula is updated.  All matrixes would be recalculated
        at that time otherwise the current formula is used for all calculations of
        new and updated data.  Calculations of intent rankings may be\nmade on a periodic
        basis, e.g. hourly, daily, etc or may be made on the fly, i.e. each page view
        or after a threshold number of page views.  Other timeframes will be apparent
        to the person skilled in the art.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 11 shows a chart of a hypothetical
        visualization of how the Intent Ranking Formula might evaluate a \"purchase\"
        intent and an \"order tracking\" intent for a single page on a customer's
        website.\n<BR><BR> As described above, the intent engine 20 may be provided
        as a third party offering to namespace administrators.  These administrators
        may thus be considered as customer's of the intent engine.  The intent engine
        20 may provide a database-backed\ninterface 16 to allow a customer to administer
        their intent engine account.  This includes defining and configuring the customer's
        namespace, configuring and monitoring Intent options, and viewing various
        usage and trending reports.\n<BR><BR> In addition, an Intent Engine administrator
        website allows for the intent engine administrator 18 to configure and monitor
        of the entire intent engine system and customers.  This includes overall reporting,
        support, billing, and access control.\n<BR><BR> Page Management\n<BR><BR>
        In general, the intent engine's algorithms and features are page-centric.
        \ Thus, Page Management is a critical step in configuring and managing an
        intent engine installation.\n<BR><BR> The intent engine tracks each distinct
        URL of a NameSpace as a Page.  There are many corner cases that affect the
        definition of a page, but in the most general case the intent engine considers
        a unique page to be represented by the part of the\nURL between the Scheme
        and the Query String.\n<BR><BR> Page Terminology\n<BR><BR> There are several
        contexts of a Page in the intent engine, as follows.\n<BR><BR> Current Page--represents
        the URL that the visitor is currently viewing in the browser window.  The
        intent engine 20 uses the top or parent page and ignores iFrames, Frames,
        and other embedded page types.\n<BR><BR> Destination Candidate--represents
        a list of Pages that the intent engine 20 recommends to the visitor based
        upon the Current Page and the Current Intent.\n<BR><BR> Recommended Destination--the
        top rated Destination Candidate.\n<BR><BR> Destination Link--the dynamically
        composed URL of a Destination Candidate.  It is dynamically composed so that
        session specific information is handled appropriately.\n<BR><BR> Page Rules\n<BR><BR>
        Account Administrators and Account Moderators may be nominated for each account
        and allowed modify the Page Rules for an intent engine account.  The Page
        Rules determine how URLs are parsed to identify unique pages and how URLs
        are dynamically\nre-assembled to provide Destination Links when the user chooses
        to jump directly to a Recommended Destination Page.\n<BR><BR> Basic URL Identification\n<BR><BR>
        All URLs are initially identified by the Host and Path.  Scheme, Query String,
        and Fragments are generally ignored in respect to identifying unique Pages.
        \ For example:\n<BR><BR> TABLE-US-00003 URL: http://www.server.com/path/to/file/page.html?one=l&two=2&three=3
        Scheme http:// Host www.server.com Path path/to/file/page.html QueryString
        one=1&two=2&three=3\n<BR><BR> Supported Scheme\n<BR><BR> The intent engine
        20 may track which schemes have been used to view each rated page.  The visitors'
        current URL scheme may be used for destination pages when possible.  Therefore,
        if the destination page has only been viewed via HTTPS and the\nvisitor is
        on another page using HTTP, then the destination page link will use HTTPS.
        \ However, if the page has been visited via both schemes, the user's current
        scheme will be used.  Optionally, the Account may be configured to always
        use the visitor's\ncurrent Scheme when constructing Destination Links.\n<BR><BR>
        Authority (Sub-Domain)\n<BR><BR> Customer NameSpaces may be configured to
        dynamically handle URLs that are differentiated only by the authority/sub-domain.
        \ For example, the JCPenney NameSpace would be configured such that ww2.jcpenney.com
        and ww5.jcpenney.com are considered\nthe same URL.  However, blog.jcpenney.com
        and search.jcpenney.com may be treated as different URLs.  By default, all
        Host name permutations will be treated as unique and independent.  The Customer
        NameSpace may be configured with regular expressions that\ndescribe Host names
        that should be treated the same.\n<BR><BR> Default Query String Management\n<BR><BR>
        In general, Query Strings will be ignored by the intent engine's page definitions.
        \ That is, the uniqueness of a page is not determined by the Query String.
        \ However, the intent engine 20 may track which Query String Parameters have
        been used\nfor each page and what value was assigned to each parameter the
        first time it was encountered.  These values will be used to help construct
        Destination Links.\n<BR><BR> Destination Links will be crafted based upon
        the visitor's current page Query String and the known Query String Parameters
        supported by the destination page.  For example, for a given url such as:\n<BR><BR>
        www.server.com/pageone.html?state=ny&color=blue,\n<BR><BR> the intent engine
        may record the following types of information about the url.\n<BR><BR> TABLE-US-00004
        URL ID Param Default Value 101 state ny 101 color blue\n<BR><BR> For a future
        visitor that is viewing the page www.server.com/pagetwo.html?state=tx&sz=lg,
        the intent engine's Destination Link to pageone will be composed by comparing
        the visitor's current Query String Parameters to those known to be supported\nby
        the intent engine.\n<BR><BR> \"state\" is supported by pageone and included
        in the visitor's current page.\n<BR><BR> Parameter values will be used from
        the current page when possible.  Therefore, the \"tx\" value will be assigned
        to \"state\" for the Destination Candidate link.\n<BR><BR> \"color\" is supported
        by pageone but not included in the current page.  \"color\" with the default
        value \"blue\" will be used for the Destination Candidate link.\n<BR><BR>
        \"sz\" is included on the Current Page, but not in the Destination Candidate.
        \ Therefore \"sz\" will not be included in the Destination Candidate link.\n<BR><BR>
        Therefore, the Destination Link from pagetwo to pageone for this user will
        be: www.server.com/pageone.html?state=tx&color=blue\n<BR><BR> Fixed Query
        String Parameters\n<BR><BR> Many websites will require additional configurations
        to intelligently handle Query String Parameters.  A common example would be
        a url like http://www.google.com/search?q=schueler where the \"q\" Query String
        Parameter (QSP) is critical to the\ndefinition of the page.  The intent engine
        may allow customers to configure QSP's that are to be treated as part of the
        unique identification of a page.\n<BR><BR> In this case, \"q\" would be identified
        as a Fixed QSP and thus the intent engine will record unique page instances
        for http://www.google.com/search?q=schueler and http://www.google.com/search?q=beynon
        and will not replace the \"q\" value when\nconstructing Destination Candidates.\n<BR><BR>
        Managing Account Intents\n<BR><BR> Account Administrators and Account Moderators
        may view and edit the list of known Intents for their NameSpace.  In particular,
        new intents may be added and intents may be deleted, in particular where those
        intents have been indicated by visitors\nto the page.  Intents provided by
        visitors may also be modified by the administrators/moderators, for example,
        to use consistent terminology and/or terminology preferred by the namespace
        owner.\n<BR><BR> Site Conversion\n<BR><BR> Website \"conversion\" is one of
        the most traditional and widespread measures of a site's effectiveness.  Analytics
        packages and entire web site strategies are often geared around a company's
        definition of \"conversion\" of a site visitor. \nConversion may be defined
        in a multitude of ways including purchasing a product, subscribing to a newsletter,
        submitting contact information, or becoming a \"fan\" via a social networking
        site.\n<BR><BR> The intent engine 20 provides a model for incorporating traditional
        site Conversion metrics into aggregate intent data.\n<BR><BR> Conversion Rules\n<BR><BR>
        The Account Administrator may define a set of Conversion URLs via regular
        expressions.  The intent engine 20 will provide a set of example regular expressions
        that will match a variety of common URL patterns.  One usage option will be
        to append\na specially coded Query String Parameter to any URL on the site
        that will indicate that the user has completed some form of conversion.\n<BR><BR>
        Whenever a Conversion URL is encountered, the intent engine will record the
        instance and gather aggregate data about pre-defined conversion that may be
        viewed via the intent Reports.\n<BR><BR> Conversion Rule Data\n<BR><BR> TABLE-US-00005
        Field Description ID unique identifier Name Short descriptor Marketing Campaign
        Optional.  ID of corresponding marketing campaign.  URLs Set of regular expressions
        that trigger conversion.  Start Date Beginning of date range when\nthe rule
        applies End Date End of date range when the rule applies\n<BR><BR> Conversion
        Event Data\n<BR><BR> Once a visitor has triggered a Conversion Rule, the intent
        engine 20 will record the Conversion Event using data similar to the table
        below.  However, the system may be configured so that a visitor will only
        trigger a Conversion Rule once per\nvisit even if they load multiple URLs
        that match the given regular expression(s).\n<BR><BR> TABLE-US-00006 Field
        Description Conversion Rule Which rule triggered conversion Converted_At Date/Time
        of the event URL The source URL of conversion Intent The user's current intent,
        if defined.\n<BR><BR> Campaign Management\n<BR><BR> Campaigns are the website
        owner's method for implementing temporary modifications to the intent engine's
        configuration to achieve specific marketing or support goals.\n<BR><BR> Pre-Seeding
        Campaign\n<BR><BR> Pre-seeding campaigns are used to \"seed\" the intent engine
        with sufficient data for the system to be released to the general population.\n<BR><BR>
        The first step of a pre-seeding campaign is to manually enter Intents and
        Destination Links for the NameSpace.  A user interface is provided to the
        namespace administrator 16 to allow administrators and moderators of a namespace
        to enter the\nrequired values and match them together and to store the pre-seed
        data in the databases 23 of the intent engine 20.\n<BR><BR> The second step
        of a pre-seeding campaign is to invite a select group of users to browse the
        website with the intent engine in seeding-mode for that namespace.  For example,
        the pre-seeding visitors may be prompted to rate the webpages for the\nvisitor's
        intent with all the data being stored as seed data that will later be used
        to make recommendations.  For the pre-seeding visitors, all recommendations
        may be blocked until sufficient data has been stored so that statistically
        relevant\nrecommendations can be made.  Options for pre-seeding visitors include
        hiding all Destination Recommendation features, hiding for X % of visitors
        but displaying for y %, only displaying recommendations for users within a
        certain IP range (employees\npre-seed), displaying for users with a certain
        cookie, prompting for a list of intents on each page, not just one intent,
        etc. Other pre-seeding options and strategies will be apparent to a person
        skilled in the art.\n<BR><BR> Spotlight Campaign\n<BR><BR> A spotlight campaign
        may be used to artificially promote certain Intents and/or Destination Candidates
        to highlight items for customer support or marketing purposes.\n<BR><BR> Options
        for spotlighting may include, artificially inflating the ranking of an Intent
        across the site or for a range of pages, artificially inflating the ranking
        of a Page for a set of Intents and/or inserting a new, temporary Intent, that
        only\nexists for the duration of the Campaign\n<BR><BR> Content Moderation\n<BR><BR>
        A Content Moderator may be provided for each customer account and may use
        the intent engine website to manage Content Filters, Content Governors, and
        Content Alerts.\n<BR><BR> Content Filters\n<BR><BR> Content filtering rules
        provide two levels of brand protection.  First, the Moderator may establish
        the Acceptable Use Policy filters that determine which words and phrases that
        should be blocked for the website community.  Second, the Moderator\nmay establish
        procedures for dealing with content that violates the site's AUP.\n<BR><BR>
        AUP Language Filter\n<BR><BR> Moderators may upload and edit a word list of
        unacceptable words that will be filtered from the site.  In one embodiment,
        a pre-loaded or default wordlist may be provided.\n<BR><BR> AUP Brand Filter\n<BR><BR>
        Moderators may also upload and edit a word list of competitor brand related
        terms that may be moderated differently than swear words.  This list aims
        to protect the site from crowd based attacks on the integrity of the intent
        engine's data set. \nFor example, a manufacturer of one type of product may
        wish to prevent a visitor from specifying an intent to buy a rival manufacturer's
        equivalent product.\n<BR><BR> AUP Filter Actions\n<BR><BR> The Moderator may
        be provided with the ability to configure Filtering Actions for both the Language
        Filter and the Brand Filter.  Unique actions may be configured based upon
        the violated filter and the type of content.\n<BR><BR> Mask Words\n<BR><BR>
        Entries are accepted by the system but triggering words are masked with a
        pre-defined character sequence.  The Moderator may choose the masking character
        and a fixed number of times to use the character.  Thus, no matter the length
        of the word\nit will be replaced with a fixed length character mask.  This
        may be provided as the default for Open Text Entries that violate the Language
        Filter.\n<BR><BR> Discard Entries\n<BR><BR> Entries are discarded before being
        saved to the database.  A running log is updated to note the action, but the
        actual entry is not saved.  This may be the default setting for Intent Entries
        that violate the Language Filter.\n<BR><BR> Moderator Alerts\n<BR><BR> Entries
        are accepted into the system and put into immediate use.  However, the Account
        Moderator is alerted and given the opportunity to remove the entry.  Notification
        is a two-fold process.  First, a daily email is sent to the Moderators with\na
        summary of the Content Alerts.  Second, the intent engine website's account
        moderation screen will provide access to entries that may need moderating
        based upon the Language and Brand Filters.  The Moderator may choose to apply
        word masks or hide the\nentries from users.  This may be the default setting
        for Intent Entries and Open Text Entries that violate the Brand Filter.\n<BR><BR>
        Moderator Approval\n<BR><BR> Entries will not be shown to future users until
        a Moderator approves them.  These Entries will be listed in a \"pending\"
        list until the Moderator approves or discards each entry.  Discarded entries
        will be purged from the system.\n<BR><BR> Governors\n<BR><BR> Account Moderators
        may configure various governors to try to prevent abuse of the intent engine
        system.  For example, user Governors may be designed to prevent a given user,
        or Bot, from flooding the intent engine.  User governors may be based\nupon
        an IP address, cookies, limiting new intents submitted per user per timeframe,
        limiting intent Page Views submitted per user per timeframe, limiting page
        ratings submitted per user per timeframe.  Content governors may be employed
        to protect the\nintent engine from crowd-based attacks to game the system.
        \ Content governors may be language and/or brand filter based.\n<BR><BR> Alerts\n<BR><BR>
        Account Moderators may receive various intent engine usage alerts as will
        be described below.\n<BR><BR> Language & Brand Filter Thresholds\n<BR><BR>
        The Moderator may define a per hour threshold for the usage of any word or
        phrase in the Language and Brand filter lists.  When this threshold is exceeded
        an email is sent to the account Moderator.  The threshold may be throttled
        uniquely for\neach filter list and it may be turned off temporarily.\n<BR><BR>
        Volume Thresholds\n<BR><BR> The Moderator may define per hour and per day
        volume thresholds for Intent Page Views, New Intent Submissions, and Page
        Ratings.  Thresholds may be specific counts (i.e. &gt;10 k) or based on relative
        changes.\n<BR><BR> Black List and White List Alerts\n<BR><BR> Moderators may
        configure a Black List of undesirable words or phrases and a White List of
        desired words and phrases.  Usage of these words in a new intent or open text
        feedback will immediately send an email alert to the Moderator in case\nimmediate
        action is required.\n<BR><BR> Reports\n<BR><BR> Account Administrators and
        Moderators may view various reports about intent engine usage and trends.
        \ These reports may be executed as one or more queries to the database 23
        coupled to the intent engine 20.\n<BR><BR> For example, an overall site success
        report may specify: Overall site success percentage; Conversion percentages
        (for each Conversion Rule); Search percentage; Browse percentage.\n<BR><BR>
        An Intent Summary Report may include statistics for Success percentage per
        Intent; Top Success Pages per Intent; Conversion percentages per Intent; Filter
        by User Generated Intents vs pre-defined Intents.\n<BR><BR> An Intent Drill
        Down Report may include statistics for Overall success of an Intent; Most
        Effective (highly rated) Pages of an Intent; Popular Pages of an Intent.\n<BR><BR>
        A Page Summary Report may include statistics for Listing of pages as defined
        by the intent engine, which may be sorted by Intent when viewing the page;
        intent engine Effectiveness (user ratings); intent engine Popularity (viewed
        with any Intent)\nand Conversion.\n<BR><BR> A Page Drill Down Report may list
        all Intents used for the given Page as well as Intent Effectiveness on the
        page, Conversion on the page and Success (highest rating) on the page.\n<BR><BR>
        As described above, the intent engine service website provides a turn-key
        service for subscribing, implementing, monitoring, and maintaining the intent
        tools on a customer's website.  A customer may subscribe to the intent engine
        by filling out\na secure web-form which identifies the business account and
        the initial administration user.  From there, the customer may download the
        necessary files to begin the intent engine rollout on their own website.\n<BR><BR>
        Business Account (Account)\n<BR><BR> All subscription levels will provide
        at least two initial User Seats (Users).  The first User will be given Account
        Administrator rights and the second user will be given Account Moderator rights.
        \ Additional seats may be available depending\nupon the subscription level
        or may be added a la carte.\n<BR><BR> Account data may include:\n<BR><BR>
        Company Name\n<BR><BR> Business Unit (optional)\n<BR><BR> Subscription Settings\n<BR><BR>
        Current subscription level & status\n<BR><BR> Monthly or Annual payments\n<BR><BR>
        Subscription history\n<BR><BR> Billing Info (address, payment information)\n<BR><BR>
        Billing Contact\n<BR><BR> Address\n<BR><BR> Payment method\n<BR><BR> Credit
        Card or Purchase Orders\n<BR><BR> Payment history\n<BR><BR> An Account Manager\n<BR><BR>
        Users\n<BR><BR> Account administrators (which users may manage the account)\n<BR><BR>
        Account Moderator\n<BR><BR> NameSpace\n<BR><BR> Rules that define the websites
        that the intent engine will support.\n<BR><BR> Account NameSpace\n<BR><BR>
        The Account NameSpace (NameSpace) defines the websites that will be supported
        by this Account.  Typically, only one NameSpace is provided per Business Account,
        but the NameSpace may represent multiple websites.\n<BR><BR> A typical example
        would be where a NameSpace includes variations of a domain name and/or geographic
        indications, such as .com and .co.uk.\n<BR><BR> The NameSpace is defined by
        one or more Regular Expressions.  Sample Regular Expressions may be provided
        that cover several basic types of NameSpace definitions.\n<BR><BR> From the
        foregoing, it can be seen that the functions of intent engine may be incorporated
        into webpages by a configurable widget that provides subscribers with an easy
        to implement, continuously learning, social site navigation system that\naddresses
        findability problems on the website.  The intent engine increases user success
        at a low cost to the subscriber and with minimal IT and maintenance commitment.\n<BR><BR>
        The intent engine helps website visitors find the content that is most likely
        to lead to a successful visit based upon the user's reason for visiting the
        site.  The intent engine utilizes a dynamic, crowd sourced, and url aware
        recommendation\nsystem to predict the user's Visit Intent and to suggest Destination
        Pages.\n<BR><BR> The intent tool has been described herein as a third party
        service offering made to owners and administrators of websites and namespaces.
        \ A person skilled in the art will recognize that the intent tool can be a
        tool that is incorporated into a\nwebspace by the webspace administrator directly,
        without the need for billing aspects and the like.\n<BR><BR> Although embodiments
        of the present invention have been illustrated in the accompanied drawings
        and described in the foregoing description, it will be understood that the
        invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed, but is capable of\nnumerous
        rearrangements, modifications, and substitutions without departing from the
        spirit of the invention as set forth and defined by the following claims.
        \ For example, the capabilities of the invention can be performed fully and/or
        partially by one\nor more of the blocks, modules, processors or memories.
        \ Also, these capabilities may be performed in the current manner or in a
        distributed manner and on, or via, any device able to provide and/or receive
        information.  Further, although depicted in a\nparticular manner, various
        modules or blocks may be repositioned without departing from the scope of
        the current invention.  Still further, although depicted in a particular manner,
        a greater or lesser number of modules and connections can be utilized\nwith
        the present invention in order to accomplish the present invention, to provide
        additional known features to the present invention, and/or to make the present
        invention more efficient.  Also, the information sent between various modules
        can be sent\nbetween the modules via at least one of a data network, the Internet,
        an Internet Protocol network, a wireless source, and a wired source and via
        plurality of protocols.\n<BR><BR><CENTER><b>* * * * *</b></CENTER>\n<HR>\n
