        <HR> <BR><BR>CROSS REFERENCE TO\nRELATED APPLICATIONS\n<BR><BR> Priority is
        claimed of related Japan Patent Application JP2004-052835, filed 27 Feb.  2004.\n<BR><BR>FIELD
        OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR> The present invention relates to the authentication
        of a person in question and, more particularly, to an authentication method
        using a hardware token such as an Integrated Circuit (IC) card.\n<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
        ART\n<BR><BR> In recent years, electronic commerce activities in companies
        for example have increased and there have been rapidly increasing tendencies
        to protect personal information in companies.\n<BR><BR> For example, leakage
        of personal information from a company leads to a considerable loss of social
        trust in the company, including loss of confidence in company management.\n<BR><BR>
        On the other hand, hiring of temporary employees and outsourcing of operations
        have become prevalent in companies, and the kinds of persons accessing intra-company
        networks for example and the forms of access to such networks have been\ndiversified.
        \ As a result, even in the case of an intra-company network, it is difficult
        to maintain a computer system in a secure state if only conventional user
        identifiers (IDs) and passwords are used.\n<BR><BR> A high level of security
        is also required, for example, in settlement systems, various management systems
        in the field of education, public systems related to administrative offices,
        taxation businesses, distribution systems using electronic\nmoney for example,
        as well as in intra-company systems.  Under these circumstances, techniques
        for individual authentication using hardware tokens typified by IC cards have
        been adopted to cope with menaces such as \"eavesdrop\", \"falsification\"
        and\n\"spoofing\".\n<BR><BR> FIGS. 12(a) and 12(b) are diagrams for explaining
        a conventional password authentication method using an IC card.  FIG. 12(a)
        shows processing at the time of installation of a certificate, and FIG. 12(b)
        shows processing at the time of use of\nthe certificate.  In the figures are
        illustrated a computer (PC) 201 which accesses a remote access unit (not shown)
        via a network such as the Internet, and an IC card 202 connected to the computer
        201 by being inserted in an IC card reader/writer for\nexample.  A certificate
        authority 203 connected to the computer 201 via the Internet is also illustrated.\n<BR><BR>
        Referring to FIG. 12(a), in the conventional password authentication method,
        in phase 1, a password (PIN (personal identity number) code) is first set
        in IC card 202 from computer 201 at the time of installation (also referred
        to as\npersonalization or initialization) of a certificate.  In phase 2, a
        public key and a secret key combination is created and stored in IC card 202.
        \ Thereafter, in phase 3, computer 201 reads out the public key from the IC
        card 202.  In phase 4, computer\n201 makes application to certificate authority
        203 for enrollment of the public key.  In phase 5, certificate authority 203
        issues a certificate for this public key to computer 201.  In phase 6, computer
        201 stores the public key certificate obtained\nfrom certificate authority
        203 in IC card 202.\n<BR><BR> Referring to FIG. 12(b), use of the certificate
        is as follows.  In phase 1, IC card 202 is connected to computer 201 and the
        password is input through computer 201.  In phase 2, verification of the password
        is performed in IC card 202, and in\nthe case where the correct password is
        input, a reply \"OK\" indicating that the password is correct is output from
        the IC card 202 to the computer 201.  Password input and verification, or
        collation, performed in this manner enables authentication that a\nperson
        who has accessed computer 201 by inserting IC card 202 in the IC card reader/writer
        and has entered a password is an authorized person.  Thereafter, in phase
        3, readout of the public key, and in phase 3', authentication with the secret
        key and so\non, are performed between computer 201 and IC card 202.\n<BR><BR>
        Heretofore, a method for implementing individual authentication using a certificate
        stored in an IC card has been proposed (see, for example, Yoshio Sato, \"Individual
        Authentication by Smart Card\" UNISYS TECHNOLOGY REVIEW No. 73, May 2002 (pp\n137-139).
        \ Sato proposes various approaches for realizing authentication of individuals
        in order to prevent unauthorized access.  That is, Sato proposes prevention
        of use of an IC card by an unauthorized person, prevention of an unauthorized
        person from\nusing an IC card, prevention of stealing of a secret key, early
        detection of unauthorized use, measures to be taken after detection, measures
        to be taken when an IC card is unusable, and so forth.\n<BR><BR> In the individual
        authentication method shown in FIGS. 12(a) and 12(b), an IC card 202 is used
        to store a digital certificate for a user public key and a corresponding secret
        key.  The combination of the digital certificate and the secret key\nstored
        in the IC card 202 is used for authenticating a user when a connection is
        made to a private network from a remote base or the like by using a VPN (virtual
        private network) or the like.  Conventionally, this is not a method in which
        a certificate\nis incorporated in a Web browser on computer 201, but rather
        is a method in which a certificate is stored in a hardware token such as IC
        card 202 which can be carried as a \"key\" (that is, a hardware token) for
        operating an individual authentication\ndevice.\n<BR><BR> However, there exists
        a risk that a hardware token such as IC card 202 may be lost or stolen.  To
        address this risk, conventionally, a password is required to access to a hardware
        token, thus protecting the token from being used or accessed by a\nthird person
        obtaining the hardware token.\n<BR><BR> However, a password is not a sufficiently
        sturdy protection means because it may be stolen, such as through a furtive
        glance when input by a legitimate user, or may be compromised or leaked by
        the legitimate user in a note or otherwise.  If a\nsmart card is protected
        against access only by using a password, a security exposure remains.  These
        problems are posed by Sato (supra), and solutions proposed, such as \"not
        to leave on a desk\", \"not to use a PIN using the date or birth or the like\",
        \"to\nenable early detection of unauthorized use by indicating the login date\".
        \ These solutions fall far short of being adequate for the purpose of preventing
        unauthorized use.\n<BR><BR> There is, therefore, a need in the art for a system
        and method for improving the security level a hardware token such as an IC
        card used for authentication.\n<BR><BR> There is, further, a need in the art
        for an improved device for enabling a hardware token to be used only in a
        particular computer.\n<BR><BR> There is, further, a need in the art for enabling
        a hardware token to be used only in one or more computers certificated by
        a particular certificate authority.\n<BR><BR> It is, therefore, an object
        of the present invention to provide a hardware token, such as an IC card,
        having a markedly improved level of security against unauthorized access.\n<BR><BR>SUMMARY
        OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR> A system, method, and computer program product
        are provided for authenticating use of or access to a hardware token using
        a combination of a digital certificate and a secret key, including storing
        a computer public key Ck for a computer in the\nhardware token; storing a

        A main feature of the present invention resides in the use of combination
        of a digital certificate and a secret key to authenticate use of or access
        to a hardware token.\n<BR><BR> Two exemplary embodiments of the present invention
        will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.\n<BR><BR>Embodiment
        1\n<BR><BR> Referring to FIG. 1, a diagram illustrates the overall configuration
        of an exemplary personal authentication system to which the first and second
        embodiments of the present invention may be applied.\n<BR><BR> Computer 10
        is a client-side PC (personal computer) which makes remote accesses.  Connected
        to PC 10 by, for example, a USB connection, is hardware token 30 for performing
        personal authentication with computer 10.  Other units connected to\ncomputer
        10 via Internet 90 include a certificate authority 50 for registration and
        acquisition of a user certificate and a computer certificate, and a remote
        system 70.  Remote system 70 may comprise an intra-company system.  Remote
        system 70 includes a\nremote access apparatus 71 connected to Internet 90
        and capable of accessing, connecting and communicating to/from computer 10,
        and a remote access authentication server 72 which authenticates computer
        10 by using a user certificate at the time of remote\naccess.  Each digital
        certificate, such as a user certificate, contains information such as a serial
        number, a name of the certificate authority 50 that has issued the certificate,
        an expiration date, a name of the owner (user), and a public key for the\nowner.\n<BR><BR>
        Hardware token 30, when inserted in an IC card reader/writer, is connected
        to the computer 10 via a USB (universal serial bus).  A user public key Uk
        and a user secret key Uk' are stored in hardware token 30.  Hardware token
        30 may be one of IC\ncards collectively referred to as Smart Cards (trademark),
        a plastic card, a magnetic card, or an optical card.  IC cards usable as hardware
        token 30 include contact-type cards, such as memory cards and microprocessor
        cards, and noncontact-type cards\nsuch as near-contact-type, proximate-type,
        vicinal-type and microware-type cards.\n<BR><BR> Certificate authority 50
        is a third party agency which issues digital certificates and assures that
        a public key is authentic.  Examples of certificate authorities 50 are Toriton,
        Inc.  and VeriSign Japan K. K. Computer 10 makes an application\nto certificate
        authority 50 for registration of the user public key Uk and obtains a certificate
        for a user public key Uk from certificate authority 50.  Computer 10 accesses
        the remote access authentication server 72 by using a user public key Uk stored\nin
        hardware token 30.  At the time of this remote access, remote access authentication
        server 72 authenticates computer 10 by using a user certificate issued by
        the certificate authority 50, thus ensuring certain security.\n<BR><BR> When
        the user public key Uk stored in hardware token 30 is read out, permission
        to access hardware token 30 from the computer 10 is required.  Conventionally,
        a password is used for this permission to access hardware token 30.  In this\nembodiment,
        however, a combination of another digital certificate and a secret key other
        than the conventional password is used foraccess permission.\n<BR><BR> For
        example, a computer certificate can be used as the \"another digital certificate\"
        and \"secret key combination\" referred to therein.  Presently, in Windows
        (trademark) systems and the like, a computer certificate can be issued for
        a subject\nfor which a certificate is to be issued, as well as for an individual
        user.  When authentication of a Smart Card using a computer certificate is
        performed, only the \"rightful\" user of a computer having a combination of
        this computer certificate and a\nsecret key can access hardware token 30.\n<BR><BR>
        In this Embodiment 1, \"rightful\", as used herein, denotes in a narrow sense
        a particular computer 10 which may be used by a person to which a user certificate
        is issued.\n<BR><BR> In Embodiment 2, described below, \"rightful\" denotes
        a computer 10 in which a combination of a computer certificate, issued from
        a particular certificate authority 50, and a secret key is held.\n<BR><BR>
        However, the methods of both embodiments (Embodiment 1 and Embodiment 2),
        as also the conventional authentication based on the password method previously
        described, are in an orthogonal relationship with each other, and only the
        method of this\nembodiment may be used for authentication, or a combination
        also using the password method may be used for authentication.\n<BR><BR> Referring
        to FIG. 2, a block diagram shows an exemplary embodiment of a hardware and
        software configuration of computer 10.  Computer 10 includes central processing
        unit (CPU) 11 for controlling the operation of the computer, including executing\nvarious
        programs under the control of an operating system (OS) 20.  Random access
        memory (RAM) 12 provides data and program storage for the CPU 11, and interface
        (I/F) 13 provides for communication with hardware token 30.  Interface 13
        comprises, for\nexample, an IC card reader/writer if hardware token 30 is
        an IC card.  Computer 10 also has persistent storage 14 including, for example,
        a read only memory (ROM) and an auxiliary read/write (R/W) storage such as
        a hard disk unit.  A computer public key,\na computer secret key and, if necessary,
        a certificate authority public key, are stored in storage 14.\n<BR><BR> Operating
        system 20 may be stored in the storage 14, and is loaded to RAM 12 by CPU
        11 for execution.  The operating system 20 thus operated is provided with
        a hardware token driver 21 which drives the hardware token 30, a hardware
        token setting\nutility 22, which includes software for setting hardware token
        30, and a public key and secret key management/authentication agency utilization
        utility 23, which includes software instructions for managing a public key
        and a secret key and for utilizing\nthe certificate authority 50.\n<BR><BR>
        FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing an exemplary hardware configuration of hardware
        token 30.  Hardware token 30 includes a CPU 31 for overall control, a RAM
        32 which is a rewritable memory used as a work memory for the CPU 31, and
        a ROM 33 for\nstoring a program executed in hardware token 30.  Hardware token
        30 also has an interface (I/F) 34 communicating with, for example, an IC card
        reader/writer connected to computer 10.  Hardware token 30 also has a non-volatile
        memory 35, such as an EEPROM\n(electrically erasable programmable read-only
        memory), a flash memory or an FeRAM (ferro-electric random access memory)
        for providing security-protected storage.  A user public key Uk, a user secret
        key Uk', and a computer public key Ck or a certificate\nauthority public key
        Ak are stored in security-protected storage 35.  A passcode used at the time
        of password setting may be also stored in the storage 35 if necessary.\n<BR><BR>
        Referring to FIGS. 4 and 7, the method of personal authentication of Embodiment
        1, using the above-described functional configuration, will be described.\n<BR><BR>
        In the following description, \"user certificate Uk\" refers to a user public
        key Uk authenticated in the certificate authority 50, \"computer certificate
        Ck\" to a computer public key Ck authenticated in certificate authority 50,
        and \"certificate\nauthority certificate Ak\" to a certificate authority public
        key Ak authenticated in certificate authority 50.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 4 is a diagram
        outlining processing with respect to installation of a user certificate in
        accordance with Embodiment 1.\n<BR><BR> Referring to FIG. 4, in phase 1, computer
        10 first stores a computer public key Ck in hardware token 30 and, in phase
        3, reads out a user public key Uk stored in the memory of the hardware token
        30.  User public key Uk and a user secret key Uk'\nhad previously, in phase
        2, been prepared and stored in hardware token 30.\n<BR><BR> Computer 10 then,
        in phase 4, makes application to certificate authority 50 for registration
        of the user public key Uk and obtains a certificate for the user public key
        Uk from the certificate authority 50.  Thereafter, in phase 5 computer 10\nreceives
        and in phase 6 stores user certificate Uk (which is the user public key Uk
        authenticated in the certificate authority 50) in hardware token 30.  As described
        above, a computer certificate Ck for computer 10, which is usable by the user
        of\nhardware token 30, is also installed in hardware token 30 either during
        phase 6, when the user certificate Uk is installed, or previously.\n<BR><BR>
        FIG. 5 is a diagram for outlining processing with respect to use of a user
        certificate in Embodiment 1.\n<BR><BR> Referring to FIG. 5, in the first phase,
        random numbers R are generated from the hardware token 30 and are sent to
        computer 10.  In phase 2, computer 10 sends back to the hardware token 30
        a signature Ck'(R) formed on random numbers R with a\ncomputer secret key
        Ck'.  Hardware token 30 certifies Ck'(R) with Ck and, in phase 3, permits
        computer 10 to make access thereto if Ck'(R) is correct.  After being permitted
        to make access, computer 10 can perform operations including, in phase 4,\nreadout
        of the user public key Uk from hardware token 30 and, in phase 4', certification
        with the user secret key Uk'.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 6 is a control flow chart showing
        processing at the time of user certificate installation shown in FIG. 4.  Description
        will be made with reference to the block diagrams shown in FIGS. 2 and 3.\n<BR><BR>
        Referring to FIG. 6, in step 101, CPU 11 executes public key and secret key
        management/authentication agency utilization utility 23 to generate a computer
        public key Ck and a computer secret key Ck'\n<BR><BR> In step 102, hardware
        token setting utility 22 of computer 10 stores the computer public key Ck
        in security-protected storage 35 of hardware token 30 through interfaces 13
        and 34 of computer 10 and hardware token 30, respectively.\n<BR><BR> In step
        103, the CPU 31 of hardware token 30 generates a user public key Uk and a
        user secret key Uk' and stores the generated user public key Uk and user secret
        key Uk' in the security-protected storage 35 of hardware token 30.\n<BR><BR>
        In step 104, public key and secret key management/authentication agency utilization
        utility 23 of computer 10 reads out the user public key Uk from the hardware
        token 30 through the interfaces 13 and 34, and in step 105 makes application
        to\ncertificate authority 50 for registration of the user public key Uk.\n<BR><BR>
        In step 106, certificate authority 50 affixes a signature to user public key
        Uk, and in step 107 issues user certificate for user public key Uk to computer
        10.  The hardware token setting utility 22 of computer 10 stores user certificate
        Uk\n(which is the user public key Uk after authentication by certificate authority
        50) in the security-protected storage 35 of hardware token 30 through the
        interfaces 13, 34.  Processing at the time of user certificate installation
        is thus completed.\n<BR><BR> Referring to FIG. 7 in connection with FIG. 5,
        processing at the time of use of a user certificate is as follows.\n<BR><BR>
        In step 151, the CPU 31 of hardware token 30 generates random number R, and
        in step 152 sends random number R to computer 10 through the interfaces (I/Fs)
        13 and 34.\n<BR><BR> In step 153, computer 10 forms a signature Ck'(R) on
        the random number R with a computer secret key Ck'.  In step 154, Ck'(R) is
        sent to the hardware token 30 through the I/Fs.\n<BR><BR> In step 155, the
        CPU 31 of hardware token 30 certifies Ck'(R) sent from the computer 10 with
        the computer public key Ck.\n<BR><BR> In step 156, CPU 31 determines by certification
        whether or not Ck'(R) is correct.\n<BR><BR> In step 157, if Ck'(R) is not
        correct, CPU 31 performs rejection processing.  In step 158, if Ck'(R) is
        correct, CPU 31 informs computer 10 that Ck'(R) is correct (OK).\n<BR><BR>
        Thereafter, in step 159, in computer 10, user authentication (personal authentication)
        is performed by using the user public key Uk and the user secret key Uk' stored
        in the security-protected storage 35 of the hardware token 30 and various\nkinds
        of processing are executed.  While authentication is performed in the remote
        access authentication server 72, hardware token 30 provides computer 10 with
        information (Uk'(R')) prepared for user authentication on the basis of the
        user public key Uk,\nthe user secret key Uk' and random numbers R' provided
        from remote access authentication server 72.  In computer 10, operations including
        remote access to remote access authentication server 72 shown in FIG. 1 are
        executed by using the information\n(Uk'(R')).\n<BR><BR> According to Embodiment
        1, as described above, only the computer 10 having the computer secret key
        Ck' corresponding to the computer public key Ck stored in the hardware token
        30 can access the hardware token 30.  Thus, the level of security\nagainst
        unauthorized use of the hardware token 30 can be improved.  While the description
        has been made by assuming that only one computer certificate Uk is used for
        ease of explanation, a plurality of computer certificates may be used.\n<BR><BR>Embodiment
        2\n<BR><BR> In Embodiment 1, only a particular authorized computer 10 can
        use hardware token 30.  In Embodiment 2, this use is expanded so all computers
        10 authenticated with a public key of certificate authority 50 can use hardware
        token 30.  The same\nfunctions, as those previously described for Embodiment
        1 are represented by the same characters, and the detailed description of
        them will not be repeated.\n<BR><BR> Referring to FIG. 8, the process for
        installing a user certification in accordance with Embodiment 2 is set forth.\n<BR><BR>
        Prior to the phases represented in FIG. 8, computer 10 had made application
        to certificate authority 50 for registration of a computer public key Ck and
        had received back a certificate for the computer public key Ck and a pubic
        key Ak\n(certificate authority public key Ak) issued by certificate authority
        50.\n<BR><BR> In phase 1, computer 10 stores the certificate authority public
        key Ak in hardware token 30.  In phase 2, hardware token 30 forms a combination
        of a user public key Uk and a user secret key Uk'.  In phase 3, computer 10
        reads out the user public\nkey Uk from the hardware token 30, in phase 4 enrolls
        the public key Uk by applying to certificate authority 50 for registration
        of that user public key Uk, and in phase 5 obtains a certificate for the user
        public key Uk from certificate authority 50. \nIn phase 6, computer 10 stores
        the certificate for the user public key Uk in the hardware token 30.\n<BR><BR>
        In this manner, when a certificate for a user public key Uk is installed in
        hardware token 30, or before the certificate for a user public key Uk is installed
        in the hardware token 30, a certificate authority public key Ak, authenticated
        by a\ncertificate authority 50 in which a computer public key Ck has previously
        been authenticated, is installed in a computer (or, by the same process, in
        a plurality of computers) 10 for access by a user of hardware token 30.\n<BR><BR>
        Referring to FIG. 9, a process for using a user certificate in accordance
        with Embodiment 2, is described.\n<BR><BR> In phase 1, random number R is
        generated by hardware token 30 and sent to computer 10.  Computer 10 forms
        a signature Ck'(R) on the random number R with a computer secret key Ck' and
        in phase 2 sends Ck'(R) to hardware token 30 together with a\ncomputer certificate
        (including computer public key Ck).\n<BR><BR> Hardware token 30 certifies
        Ck by using the certificate authority public key Ak authenticated in the certificate
        authority 50.  If Ck is correct, then the hardware token 30 certifies Ck'(R)
        by using Ck.  If Ck'(R) is correct, in phase 3,\nhardware token 30 permits
        the computer 10 to make access thereto.  After being permitted to make access,
        computer 10 can perform operations including, in phase 4, readout of the user
        public key Uk from the hardware token 30 and, in phase 4',\ncertification
        with the user secret key Uk'.\n<BR><BR> Referring to FIG. 10 in connection
        with FIGS. 2, 3, and 8, processing at the time of user certificate installation
        will be described.\n<BR><BR> In step 201, public key and secret key management/authentication
        agency utilization utility 23 is executed by the CPU 11 of computer 10 to
        generate a computer public key Ck and a computer secret key Ck', and in step
        202 makes application to\nauthentication authority, or section, 50 for registration
        of the computer public key Ck.\n<BR><BR> In step 203, a signature is affixed
        to the computer public key Ck in authentication section 50, and in step 204
        a certificate for the computer public key Ck is issued from the authentication
        section 50 to the computer 10.  Also, in step 205, a\ncertificate authority
        certificate Ak authenticated in the certificate authority 50 is issued from
        the certificate authority 50 to computer 10.\n<BR><BR> In step 206, the hardware
        token setting utility 22 of computer 10 stores the certificate authority certificate
        Ak, which has been authenticated by certificate authority 50, in the security-protected
        storage 35 of hardware token 30 through the\nI/Fs (the interface 13 of the
        computer 10 and the interface 34 of the hardware token 30).\n<BR><BR> In step
        207, the CPU 31 of hardware token 30 generates a user public key Uk and a
        user secret key Uk' and stores the generated user public key Uk and user secret
        key Uk' in the security-protected storage 35 of hardware token 30.\n<BR><BR>
        In step 208, the public key and secret key management/authentication agency
        utilization utility 23 of computer 10 reads out the user public key Uk from
        hardware token 30 through the I/Fs, and in step 209 makes application to the
        certificate\nauthority 50 for registration of the user public key Uk.\n<BR><BR>
        In step 210, a signature is affixed to the user public key Uk by certificate
        authority 50, and in step 211, a user certificate Uk for the user public key
        Uk is issued (transmitted) to computer 10.\n<BR><BR> In step 212, the hardware
        token setting utility 22 of computer 10 stores the user certificate Uk authenticated
        in the certificate authority 50 in the security-protected storage 35 of hardware
        token 30 through the I/Fs.  Processing at the time of\nuser certificate installation
        is thus completed.\n<BR><BR> Referring to FIG. 11 in connection with FIG.
        9, a description will be given of processing at the time of use of a user
        certificate.\n<BR><BR> In step 251, the CPU 31 of hardware token 30 generates
        random number R, and in step 252 sends the random number R to computer 10
        through the I/Fs (the interface 34 of the hardware token 30 and the interface
        13 of the computer 10).\n<BR><BR> In step 253, computer 10 forms a signature
        Ck'(R) on the random number R with a computer secret key Ck', and in step
        254 the generated Ck'(R) is sent to hardware token 30 through the I/Fs.  Simultaneously,
        in step 255, the computer public key Ck\n(computer certificate Ck) authenticated
        in the certificate authority 50 is also sent to hardware token 30.\n<BR><BR>
        In step 256, the CPU 31 of the hardware token 30 certifies the Ck sent from
        computer 10 by using the certificate authority public key Ak stored in security-protected
        storage 35.\n<BR><BR> In step 257, the hardware token determines by certification
        whether or not Ck is correct.  If Ck is not correct, in step 258, rejection
        processing is performed.  If Ck is correct, in step 259, the Ck'(R) sent from
        the computer 10 is certified\nwith this Ck.\n<BR><BR> In step 260, determination
        is made as to whether or not Ck'(R) is correct.  If Ck'(R) is not correct,
        in step 261 rejection processing is performed.  If Ck'(R) is correct, in step
        262 information indicating that Ck'(R) is correct is sent to the\ncomputer
        10.  Thereafter, in step 263, user authentication (personal authentication)
        is performed in computer 10 by using the user public key Uk and the user secret
        key Uk' stored in the security-protected storage 35 of the hardware token
        30 and various\nadditional processing is executed.  While authentication is
        performed in the remote access authentication server 72, hardware token 30
        provides computer 10 with information (Uk'(R')) prepared for user authentication
        on the basis of the user public key Uk\nand the user secret key Uk'.  In computer
        10, operations including remote access to the remote access authentication
        server 72 shown in FIG. 1 are executed by using the information (Uk'(R')).\n<BR><BR>
        According to Embodiment 2, as described above, the computer public key Ck
        is recognized as correct when the computer public key Ck is certified with
        the certificate authority public key Ak, and certification is performed by
        using the computer\npublic key Ck, thus enabling a computer 10 having a correct
        computer public key Ck authenticated in the certificate authority 50 and a
        computer secret key Ck' to access hardware token 30.\n<BR><BR> In the above
        manner, the level of security against unauthorized use of the hardware token
        30 is improved.  Also, the hardware token 30 can be used with a plurality
        of computers 10 authenticated in a particular certificate authority 50, thus\nachieving
        a large improvement in convenience.  While it is assumed that only one certificate
        authority certificate Ak (certificate authority public key Ak authenticated
        in the above-described station 50) exists, a plurality of certificate authority\npublic
        keys Ak may exist with no problem.\n<BR><BR> While this second embodiment
        has been described with respect to a case where a computer public key Ck and
        a computer secret key Ck' are generated in computer 10, the certificate authority
        50 may directly generate keys of these kinds and issue\ncertificates for them
        in some case.  Also, while this embodiment has been described with respect
        to a case where a user public key Uk and a user secret key Uk' are generated
        in the hardware token 30, the certificate authority 50 may generate keys of\nthese
        kinds in other cases.\n<BR><BR> In this second embodiment, as described above,
        not a password but a combination of another digital certificate (a public
        key authenticated in certificate authority 50) and a secret key is used as
        the authentication means for authorizing or\npermitting access to hardware
        token 30, thereby enabling identification of a computer 10 permitted to use
        the hardware token 30.  Thus, an authorized use of hardware token 30 can be
        inhibited and the security of the system can be effectively improved.\n<BR><BR>
        Good use of the present invention can be made, for example, in various computers
        such as notebook PCs and desktop PCs, as also in hardware tokens such as IC
        cards, and network systems using such computers and hardware tokens.  Also,
        good use of\nthe present invention can be made, for example, as a program
        executed in such computers.\n<BR><BR>ADVANTAGE OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR>
        It is an advantage of the present invention that a combination of a digital
        certificate and a secret key is used to authenticate access to a hardware
        token to effectively improve the level of security against unauthorized access
        when a hardware\ntoken is used.\n<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF SYMBOLS AND COMPUTATIONS\n<BR><BR>

        a user public key may be made by a certificate authority by signning Uk and
        its subject using the secret key Ak' of the certificate authority.  Signning
        means the mathematical calculation\nUk+Subject+Enc(MD(Uk+Subject), Ak'), where
        + is a concatenation function, Subject is additional information for the certificate,
        MD is a message digest function such as SHA, and Enc(X, Y) is a function to
        encrypt X using key Y based on a public key\nencryption algorithm such as
        RSA.\n<BR><BR> Creation of a signature Ck'(R) formed on random numbers R with
        a computer secret key Ck', may be calculated as Enc(MD(R), Ck'), where MD
        is a message digest function such as SHA, and Enc is a public key encryption

        previously calculating MD(R), where MD is a message digest function, and then,
        to authenticate Ck'(R), calculate Dec(Ck'(R), Ck), where Dec(X, Y) is a function
        to decrypt X using key\nY based on a public key encryption algorithm.  If
        MD(R) and Dec(Ck'(R), Ck) is the same, it is authenticated.  If it is not
        the same, authentication fails.\n<BR><BR> Forming Uk'(R') on the basis of
        user secret key Uk' and random number R' is done by determining Enc(MD(R'),
        Uk'), where MD is a message digest function, Enc(X, Y) is a function to encrypt
        X using key Y based on a public key encryption algorithm.\n<BR><BR>Alternative
        Embodiments\n<BR><BR> It will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments
        of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration,
        various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope
        of the invention.  In particular,\nit is within the scope of the invention
        to provide a computer program product or program element, or a program storage
        or memory device such as a solid or fluid transmission medium, magnetic or
        optical wire, tape or disc, or the like, for storing signals\nreadable by
        a machine, for controlling the operation of a computer according to the method
        of the invention and/or to structure its components in accordance with the
        system of the invention.\n<BR><BR> Further, each step of the method may be
        executed on any general computer, such as IBM Systems designated as zSeries,
        iSeries, xSeries, and pSeries, or the like and pursuant to one or more, or
