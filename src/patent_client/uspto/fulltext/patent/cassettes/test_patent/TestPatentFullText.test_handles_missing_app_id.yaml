        are drilled is divided into multi-stage zones that\n     are further divided
        into single-stage zones. Each single-stage zone is\n     perforated and then

        fracture each of the single-stage zones within a\n     multi-stage zone; the
        fracturing stages being separated by ball sealers.\n     Well spacing may

        <HR> <BR><BR>We claim: <BR><BR>1.  A method for stimulating production from
        wells drilled into reservoirs characterized by lenticular gas-bearing deposits
        comprising:\n<BR><BR>(1) perforating said wells in a plurality of single-stage
        zones spaced along the thickness of said reservoir,\n<BR><BR>(2) fracturing
        said single-stage zones in multiple stages, said stages being separated by
        ball sealers and said fracturing being controlled to create lateral fractures
        which will drain an area that approximates the average horizontal area of
        said\nlenticular gas-bearing deposits in the vicinity of said single-stage
        zones.\n<BR><BR>2.  The method of claim 1 wherein said reservoir thickness
        is divided into a plurality of multi-stage zones, each multi-stage zone having
        two or more single stage zones.\n<BR><BR>3.  The method of claim 1 wherein
        the height of said fractures are approximately equal to the corresponding
        vertical length of said single-stage zones.\n<BR><BR>4.  The method of claim
        1 wherein the total length of said lateral fractures approximates the average
        horizontal diameter of said lenticular gas-bearing deposits.\n<BR><BR>5.  The
        method of claim 1 wherein the total length of said lateral fractures approximates
        the average length of said lenticular gas-bearing deposits, said length being
        the distance across said lenticular deposits in the direction of the\norientation
        of said fractures.\n<BR><BR>6.  The method of claim 1 wherein said fracturing
        is conducted using a non-Newtonian fluid.\n<BR><BR>7.  The method of claim
        6 wherein said non-Newtonian fluid is a cross-linked gelled water.\n<BR><BR>8.
        \ The method of claim 1 wherein said single-stage zones are perforated in
        the approximate geometric center of said zones.\n<BR><BR>9.  A method for
        developing a reservoir characterized by lenticular gas-bearing deposits comprising:\n<BR><BR>(1)
        drilling a well into said reservoir,\n<BR><BR>(2) perforating said well in
        single-stage zones spaced along the thickness of said reservoir, said reservoir
        thickness being divided into multiple multi-stage zones, each multi-stage
        zone having two or more single-stage zones,\n<BR><BR>(3) fracturing said single-stage
        zones within each multi-stage zone in multiple stages, said stages being separated
        by ball sealers and said fracturing being controlled to create lateral fractures
        which will drain an area that approximates the\naverage horizontal area of
        said lenticular gas-bearing deposits in the vicinity of said multi-stage zone,\n<BR><BR>(4)
        repeating the process of drilling, perforating and fracturing additional wells
        into said reservoir such that the cross-sectional area in the reservoir surrounding
        each well is not less than the approximate average drainage area of the lateral\nfractures
        along the length of said well.\n<BR><BR>10.  The method of claim 9 wherein
        the height of said fractures are approximately equal to the corresponding
        vertical length of said single-stage zones.\n<BR><BR>11.  The method of claim
        9 wherein the total length of said lateral fractures approximates the average
        length of said lenticular gas-bearing deposits, said length being the distance
        across said lenticular deposits in the direction of the\norientation of said
        fractures.\n<BR><BR>12.  The method of claim 9 wherein said fracturing is
        conducted using a non-Newtonian fluid.\n<BR><BR>13.  The method of claim 12
        wherein said non-Newtonian fluid is a cross-linked gelled water.\n<BR><BR>14.
        \ The method of claim 9 wherein said single-stage zones are perforated in
        the approximate geometric center of said zones.\n<BR><BR>15.  The method of
        claim 9 wherein said cross-sectional area in the reservoir surrounding each
        well roughly equals the approximate average drainage area of the lateral fractures
        along the length of said well.\n<BR><BR>16.  The method of claim 15 wherein
        said cross-sectional area in the reservoir surrounding each well averages
        between about 40,000 to 122,000 square meters (10 to 30 acres).\n<BR><BR>17.
        \ A method for developing a reservoir characterized by lenticular gas-bearing
        deposits comprising:\n<BR><BR>(1) drilling wells into said reservoir such
        that the average horizontal cross-sectional area in the reservoir surrounding
        each well is not less than the approximate average cross-sectional area of
        said lenticular gas-bearing deposits in said\nreservoir,\n<BR><BR>(2) perforating
        said wells in single-stage zones spaced along the thickness of said reservoir,
        said reservoir thickness being divided into multiple multi-stage zones, each
        multi-stage zone having two or more single-stage zones,\n<BR><BR>(3) fracturing
        said single-stage zones within each multi-stage zone in multiple stages, said
        stages being separated by ball sealers and said fracturing being controlled
        to create lateral fractures in each well which extend to the lenticular\ngas-bearing

        RELATED APPLICATION\n<BR><BR>This application claims the benefit of U.S.  Provisional
        Application No. 60/057,202, filed Aug.  26, 1997.\n<BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR>The
        present invention relates to the stimulation of production from natural gas
        reservoirs that are characterized by lenticular gas-bearing formations.  More
        specifically, the invention relates to production optimization using ball
        sealers for\nmulti-stage fracturing of properly spaced wells and perforated
        zones.\n<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR>Hydraulic fracturing
        is a well-known technique for stimulating production from subterranean hydrocarbon-bearing
        formations.  In a typical operation, an interval of a wellbore adjacent to
        a formation is perforated and fracturing fluid is pumped\ninto the formation
        at a pressure sufficient to fracture the formation both laterally, away from
        the wellbore, and vertically, along the length of the wellbore.  Propping
        agents such as sand or bauxite are usually mixed in with the fracturing fluid
        in\norder to enter the fractures and maintain them open once the pressure
        is reduced.  This treatment enhances the productivity of the formation and
        thereby increases hydrocarbon production rates.\n<BR><BR>Hydraulic fracturing
        has been successfully employed in many types of hydrocarbon formations, particularly
        low permeability reservoirs which require stimulation to accelerate production
        to flow rates which make the reservoir economic to develop. \nOccasionally,
        conventional fracturing techniques have to be modified to stimulate a reservoir.
        \ For example, some reservoirs have many hydrocarbon bearing formations that
        are vertically stacked along the length of the wellbore and which are separated
        by\nessentially impermeable, non-hydrocarbon bearing formations.  Techniques
        have been developed which permit successive fracturing of each of the formations.
        \ Temporary means are used to seal off the perforations adjacent to one formation
        that has been\nfractured while a subsequent fracture treatment is conducted
        at a different depth in the same formation or in another formation.  Mechanical
        devices such as bridge plugs and packers have been used to separate treatment
        zones, and more recently,\nmulti-zone fracturing using inexpensive ball sealers
        has been employed.\n<BR><BR>Although hydraulic fracturing technology has progressed
        to where many low permeability hydrocarbon formations can be economically
        produced, there are certain types of natural gas reservoirs which continue
        to defy economic fracturing exploitation;\nspecifically, reservoirs which
        are characterized by discontinuous lenticular gas-bearing sand deposits of
        limited areal extent.  These lenticular sands are also frequently \"tight\"
        which means they are characterized by low or very low permeability.  Prime\nexamples
        of such tight gas reservoirs are the various basins in the Rocky Mountain
        region of the western United States (Greater Green River, Piceance, Wind River
        and Uinta) which contain numerous lenticular, tight gas sandstones within
        thick formations. \nThese four basins have been judged to be the largest undeveloped
        gas resource in the United States, containing as much as 227 trillion cubic
        meters (8,000 TCF) of recoverable gas.  These enormous gas reserves remain
        substantially undeveloped because no\neconomic method for developing these
        reserves has heretofore been developed.\n<BR><BR>Much attention has been directed
        at fracturing techniques for developing formations having tight, lenticular
        gas deposits.  Because of the enormous reserve base of potentially recoverable
        gas, a significant amount of research has been performed\nby the U.S.  Department
        of Energy, government and private research laboratories, universities and
        the private sector in an attempt to develop fracturing technology to economically
        exploit lenticular formations.  To date, these efforts have been largely\nunsuccessful.\n<BR><BR>The
        approach initially attempted to access tight lenticular formations was nuclear
        stimulation.  Under this program nuclear explosive devices were detonated
        within large diameter wellbores to generate a large zone of dendritic fractures
        in the\nzone surrounding the detonation.  The largest such experiment was
        the nuclear detonation in a lenticular gas formation near Rio Blanco, Colo.,
        equivalent to 90 kilotons of dynamite.  In addition to the obvious environmental,
        health and safety concerns\nassociated with nuclear stimulation, such experiments
        were not successful in releasing significant volumes of gas reserves.  The
        lack of control over the explosive fracturing and the subsequent closure of
        the dendritic fractures caused the nuclear\nstimulation projects to fall far
        short of expected gas stimulation results.\n<BR><BR>In the early 1970's the
        next approach chosen to stimulate tight gas lenticular formations was a new
        process, termed massive hydraulic fracturing (MHF), which envisioned creating
        very long fractures up to 1.6 kilometers (one mile) or more in\nlength using
        very large volumes of fracturing fluid and proppant.  Under the sponsorship
        of the Department of Energy, a joint industry consortium tested MHF treatments
        in the Rio Blanco region.  To illustrate this project, one fracture treatment
        injected\n398,250 kg (878,000 lbs) of sand proppant into one 28 m (91 ft)
        section of the formation during an MHF experiment.  Even though this MHF generated
        a dynamic fracture length of about 564 m (1,850 ft) and a propped fracture
        length of about 267 m (875 ft),\nthe resulting stimulated gas rate was only
        3,880 standard cubic meters/d (137 kscf/d) after 30 days of production.  (As
        used herein the term dynamic fracture length means the length of one wing
        of a bi-winged fracture from the wellbore to one of the tips\ncreated by the
        fracturing fluid while the terms propped fracture length or simply fracture
        length is that distance from the wellbore reached by the proppant.) Five zones
        were stimulated during the Rio Blanco experiment with various sizes of MHFs.
        \nStimulated production levels were disappointingly low, usually less than
        5,600 m.sup.3 /d (200 kscf/d), with the highest observed post fracture production
        rate being about 6,230 m.sup.3 /d (220 kscf/d); well below the desired flow
        rate of about 42,500\nm.sup.3 /d (1,500 kscf/d) after one year of production,
        which is needed to achieve economic production for the wells in question.\n<BR><BR>Unrelated
        to the Rio Blanco project, in the late 1970's enhancements in multi-stage
        fracturing were achieved in stimulating lenticular heavy oil formations [Stimulation
        of Asphaltic Deep Wells and Shallow Wells in Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela, World\nPetroleum
        Conference 1979, Bucharest, Romania, P.D.  7(1)(the \"WPC paper\")]. These
        enhancements were achieved using ball sealer diverters.  The WPC paper teaches
        that completing the wells with limited perforation intervals enables each
        stage of\nfracturing to open an independent fracture which is in communication
        with only one set of perforations.  It was found that each stage of fracture
        treatment opened about 30 vertical meters (100 ft) of zone.  Using low perforation
        shot densities of about\nthree shots per meter (1 shot per foot) over 3 m
        (10 ft) combined with proper time release of the ball sealers permits stimulation
        of all of the oil sands penetrated by a given well.  Although the WPC paper
        discusses multi-stage fracturing of heavy oil\nlenticular formations, it does
        not address methods or techniques for controlling fracture propagation in
        relationship to the size, distribution and placement of the oil sands.  Because
        these oil sands have high permeabilities in the 1-100 mD range, their\nstimulation
        does not closely correspond to stimulating production from tight gas reservoirs
        characterized by lenticular deposits such as sand lenses.  In fact, the WPC
        paper suggests that greater stimulation of the oil sands could be gained from
        longer\nfractures if an inexpensive, highly permeable proppant was used as
        an alternative to sand.  However, as noted above, very long MHF fractures
        failed to achieve desired results in lenticular sand, tight gas reservoirs.\n<BR><BR>The
        failure of the Rio Blanco project led to the Multi-Well Experiment project
        (MWX) in the 1980's that explicitly studied hydraulic fracture shapes and
        flow capacities in an attempt to enhance gas stimulation benefits.  MWX consisted
        of three\nwellbores placed about 46 m (150 ft) apart at total depth so that
        two of the wellbores could be used for close observation and monitoring of
        fracturing treatments done in the first wellbore.  Most of the fracturing
        injections into the MWX wells were\nsmall to moderate in size so that the
        monitoring wells could sense signals from the entire fractured region.  (For
        example, in one experiment the propped fracture length was only about 65 m
        (214 ft).) This work led to the conclusion that there was\nnothing inherently
        wrong with the hydraulic fractures formed in these tight gas sands, i.e.,
        fracture lengths, widths, and heights were the expected size.\n<BR><BR>The
        MWX project was followed at the same site by the M-Site project that continued
        the measurement of hydraulic fracture parameters until the end of 1996.  During
        this entire time, efforts have been directed at advancing existing technology
        to\nmore economically exploit the Rocky Mountain lenticular sands.  As described
        in SPE Paper 35,630 [Advanced Technologies for Producing Massively Stacked
        Lenticular Sands, Apr.  28, 1996], advanced stimulation techniques and the
        intersection of natural\nfractures, coupled with intensive infill well development,
        can enhance the prospects of commercial production from tight lenticular sands.
        \ This paper suggests separating the lenticular sands encountered by a well
        into a series of packages of 91 to 152 m\n(300 to 500 ft) of gross interval.
        \ In 610.sup.+ m (2000.sup.+ ft) of saturated gas zone for a typical well
        there would be four to seven such packages.  The analysis in this paper concludes
        that completing wells in multiple zones correlates strongly with\nincreases
        in production.\n<BR><BR>As to infill well development SPE 35,630 suggests
        that closer well spacing will increase total gas recovery, noting, for example,
        that at 40 acres per well 12 out of 16 wells would still penetrate separate
        sand bodies, i.e., no or limited\ninterference or communication with the sands
        of an adjacent well.  This limited interference occurs because the average
        areal extent of the lenticular sands in communication with the wells reviewed
        in SPE 35,630 is only about 22 acres.  However, even\nwith multiple zone fracturing
        and infill drilling, wells drilled with 40 acre spacing still would have a
        recovery efficiency of gas in place of only about 26%.  Thus nearly three
        fourths of the original gas in place would remain unrecovered using the\napproach
        suggested in SPE 35,630.  Although the SPE paper suggests well spacing down
        to 20 acres might further enhance recovery, it fails to disclose methods for
        controlling the stimulation techniques to capture larger quantities of the
        original gas in\nplace or the relationship between the stimulation technique
        and the spacing of the wells.  Therefore, what is needed is a well stimulation
        method for substantially enhancing production from reservoirs characterized
        by tight gas, lenticular deposits such\nthat they become commercially exploitable
        gas fields.\n<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR>This invention is directed
        to a method for stimulating production from wells drilled into reservoirs
        characterized by lenticular gas-bearing deposits.  The wells are perforated
        in a plurality of single-stage zones that are spaced along the\nthickness
        of the reservoir.  Preferably, the reservoir thickness through which the wells
        are drilled and perforated is divided into multiple multi-stage zones which
        have two or more of the single-stage zones.  The wells are then fractured
        with the\nfracturing occurring in multiple stages such that the single-stage
        zones (within a multi-stage zone) are sequentially fractured; each fracturing
        stage being separated by ball sealers.  The fracturing is controlled to create
        lateral fractures which will\ndrain an area that approximates the average
        horizontal area of the lenticular gas bearing deposits in the vicinity of
        the multi-stage zones.  In a preferred embodiment, the total length of the
        lateral fractures approximates the average diameter of the\nlenticular deposits.\n<BR><BR>In
        one embodiment of the present invention, a method is described for developing
        a reservoir characterized by lenticular gas-bearing deposits.  In this embodiment
        each well drilled into the reservoir is perforated and fractured as described\nabove.
        \ As the process of drilling, perforating and fracturing additional wells
        into the reservoir is continued, the wells are spaced such that the horizontal
        cross-sectional area in the reservoir surrounding each well is not less than
        the approximate\naverage drainage area of the lateral fractures along the
        length of the well.  In a preferred embodiment, the cross-sectional area in
        the reservoir surrounding each well roughly equals the approximate average
        drainage area of the lateral fractures along\nthe length of the well.  In
        a typical Rocky Mountain basin, the area surrounding the well would be between
        about 40,000 to 122,000 square meters (10 to 30 acres).\n<BR><BR>In another
        embodiment directed at reservoir development, the horizontal crosssectional
        area in the reservoir surrounding each well is not less than the approximate
        average cross-sectional area of the lenticular gas-bearing deposits and the\nlateral
        fractures are controlled to extend to the lenticular deposits in the vicinity
        of each well.  For this embodiment, it is preferred to have the cross-sectional
        area in the reservoir surrounding each well roughly equal to the approximate
        average\nhorizontal cross-sectional area of the gas bearing deposits.  Once
        again, the typical area surrounding the well would be between about 40,000
        to 122,000 square meters (10 to 30 acres).  It would also be preferable in
        the embodiment if the approximate\naverage drainage area of the fractures
        does not substantially exceed the average cross-sectional area of the lenticular
        deposits.\n<BR><BR>For all of the primary embodiments of the present invention
        described above, there are preferred methods for conducting the perforation
        and fracturing techniques.  In perforating the wells it is preferred to perforate
        the single-stage zones in\nthe approximate geometric center of the zones.
        \ For fracturing, the preferred fracturing fluid is a non-Newtonian fluid
        such as a cross-linked gelled water.  It is also desirable to generate fracture
        heights that are approximately equal to the\ncorresponding vertical length
        of the single-stage zones.  Where fracture orientation is known, it is also
        preferred to have the total length of the fractures approximate the average
        length of the lenticular deposits, i.e., the horizontal distance across\nthe
        lenticular deposits in the direction of the fracture orientation. <BR><BR>BRIEF

        method of this invention enables the commercial development of natural gas
        reservoirs characterized by numerous, lenticular gas-bearing deposits within
        thick formations by substantially increasing the recovery of the original
        gas in place in\nthe reservoir.  The method employs a controlled ball-sealer
        multi-stage fracturing technique which is designed to match the well drainage
        area created by the propped fracture with the approximate horizontal area
        of the lenticular gas-bearing deposits. \nIn a preferred embodiment of the
        invention, the number of wells drilled and fractured achieves well-spacing
        which is no less than the average approximate area of the gas-bearing deposits.
        \ It is contemplated that a natural gas reservoir fully developed\nusing the
        method of this invention can potentially recover a major portion of the original
        gas in place during the expected commercial life of an individual well (10-15
        years).\n<BR><BR>In the method of this invention the multi-stage fracturing
        technique is essential to maximizing exploitation of the gas reservoir.  Although
        the method is primarily directed at achieving economic production from tight
        lenticular gas sands\ntypically found in the Rocky Mountain region of the
        United States, it can also be employed to develop other types of gas-bearing
        deposits having similar characteristics.  For example, coal seams containing
        coal bed methane could also be exploited by the\nmethod of the present invention.
        \ Virtually any natural gas reservoir in which the natural gas is trapped
        in stacked, discontinuous sediments that are distributed throughout the formation
        can be developed by the method of the invention.  Thus as used in\nthis specification
        and in the claims, the term \"lenticular\" refers to any discontinuous sediment,
        pocket, layer or deposit containing natural gas and not just the lens-shaped,
        fluvial sands that typify the Rocky Mountain basins.\n<BR><BR>The term \"reservoir\"
        is also used broadly in both the context in which it is generally used in
        the oil and gas industry but also in the context of a target area of exploitation.
        \ For example, a reservoir may be a portion of a larger reservoir on\nwhich
        mineral leases are held or it may represent the \"sweet spot\" within a reservoir
        where the gas reserves may be most economically exploitable.  Alternatively,
        a reservoir may contain a number of discrete hydrocarbon deposits grouped
        in relatively\nclose proximity to each other, such as the lenticular gas sands
        described above, whether or not such deposits are of comparable geologic origin.
        \ For the purposes of the present invention the term \"reservoir\" is intended
        to mean any subterranean gas\ndeposits or portions thereof which are to be
        developed.\n<BR><BR>Referring more particularly to the drawings, FIG. 1 illustrates
        a vertical cross section of a natural gas reservoir 10 containing deposits
        of typical stacked lenticular sands 11 found around the world.  The sand lenses
        11 are of different shapes\nand sizes and have different orientations within
        reservoir 10.  The combination of the shifting meanders of the ancient river
        beds from which they were formed and geologic uplift created the widely scattered
        array of discontinuous sand lenses.  The upper\nboundary 12 and lower boundary
        13 of the reservoir define the thickness of the reservoir typically 150 m
        to 1,220 m (500 ft to 4,000 ft).  In the Piceance, Green River, and Uinta
        basins of the Rocky Mountain region, the upper boundaries of these\nreservoirs
        are typically found at depths of from about 1,830 m (6,000 ft) to 3,050 m
        (10,000 ft) below the surface.  Thus these reservoirs are at moderate depths
        compared to other natural gas formations around the world.  However, these
        are very thick\nreservoirs with stacked lenticular sands being scattered over
        a thickness 14 that generally exceeds 914 m (3,000 ft) and typically is about
        1,220 m (4,000 ft).\n<BR><BR>Also shown in FIG. 1 are imaginary boundaries
        15 and 16 which define the \"sweet spot\" of the total reservoir which has
        been selected for exploitation by the present invention.  As shown in FIG.
        1, this portion 17 of the reservoir has more\nlenticular sands than the portions
        outside boundaries 15 and 16.  The portion to the left of boundary 15 has
        a high density of lenses but is not nearly as thick as portion 17.  The portion
        to the right of boundary 16 is thick but does not have a\nsufficiently high
        lens density.  Alternatively, the portion of the reservoir between 15 and
        16 may be selected because the sands within it have higher permeability, better
        porosity, higher gas saturation, larger lens size, or other characteristics
        which\nmake it more suitable for development.  (Surface terrain, mineral lease
        boundaries and other non-reservoir factors may also restrict the portion of
        the reservoir accessible for development.) The method of the present invention
        will be directed at the\nreservoir bounded by the upper and lower boundaries
        12 and 13 and the lateral boundaries 15 and 16.\n<BR><BR>FIG. 2 illustrates
        how the reservoir might have been exploited using massive hydraulic fracturing
        (a) techniques previously discussed in the description of the prior art.  A
        single well 20 has been drilled into reservoir 10 and particularly the\ntargeted
        portion 17 that is best suited for exploitation.  The fracture 22, is typical
        of MHF fractures and laterally extends through most of the targeted reservoir
        area.  This can be as much as 1,525 m (5,000 ft) from the wellbore and is
        typically at\nleast 610 m (2,000 ft) in propped fracture length.  However,
        as is the case with most MHF fractures, the vertical height 23 of the fracture
        22 is only on the order of about 30 m (100 ft).\n<BR><BR>This result is generally
        desirable for most conventional gas reservoirs because the productive gas-bearing
        sediments are usually relatively thin, continuous, horizontal layers of sandstone
        which the MHF fully accesses both vertically and\nlaterally.  Thus the fracture
        is able to stimulate a large portion of the productive sand.  However, as
        shown in FIG. 2, the MHF of a stacked, lenticular sand reservoir results in
        the fracture only intercepting a small percentage of the productive sand\nlenses
        11.  This is because the vertical fracture height 23 extends only about 30
        m (100 ft) in contrast to the 1,220 m (4000 ft) thickness of the reservoir
        over which the lenticular sands are dispersed.  Thus most of the sand lenses
        11 in reservoir 10\nare not stimulated by the MHF process.\n<BR><BR>In contrast
        to MHF, the multi-stage fracturing system incorporated in the present invention
        accesses a major portion of the productive sands within the drainage radius
        of the well.  As will be discussed later, when coupled with the well spacing\nsystem
        disclosed herein, the multi-stage fractures of all of the drilled wells in
        the reservoir (or targeted portion thereof) will intercept the majority of
        the lenticular sands in the reservoir.\n<BR><BR>FIG. 3 illustrates a multi-stage
        fractured well drilled into the same location of the portion 17 of the reservoir
        10 where the MHF well of FIG. 2 was drilled.  The controlled multi-stage fracturing
        used in the present invention generates a\nuniformly distributed series of
        bi-wing fractures 32 along the entire thickness of the target reservoir.  Those
        skilled in the art will understand that the fractures 32 extending from well
        30, as shown in FIG. 3, are illustrative and that in actual\nfracturing applications
        there may be more fractures with different shapes extending radially outward
        from the well and that the fractures may have wings with different lengths.
        \ Moreover, the fractures at one depth may or may not be aligned with those
        at\nother nearby depths.  Nevertheless, the present invention attempts to
        generate the fractures as uniformly as possible and FIG. 3 represents an idealized
        outcome of that process.  Unlike the MHF technique, the fractures are not
        located to intercept a\nparticular producing sand or sands.  Instead the fractures
        are spaced apart by approximately equal distances, the distance between each
        fracture representing the vertical height of the fracture.  The vertical fractures
        in the multi-stage well 30 have\nabout the same vertical height as the very
        long fractures in the MHF well.  Thus, as was the case with the MHF well,
        these fractures typically have a vertical height of about 30 m (100 ft).\n<BR><BR>Where
        the multi-stage fractures are substantially different from the MHF well is
        the propped fracture length.  By controlling the amount of fracturing fluid
        and proppant for each stage, the length of fracture 32 will drain an area
        that\napproximates the average horizontal area of the lenticular sands 11
        typically found in the reservoir in the vicinity of the wellbore.  In other
        words, the distance covered by the extent of the fracture (both wings) that
        extends laterally outward from the\nwellbore (the lateral fracture) preferably
        approximates the average diameter of the lenticular sands.  Therefore, in
        contrast to the very long MHF hydraulic fractures, the multi-stage fractures
        are relatively short.\n<BR><BR>The overall effect of numerous short, uniformly
        spaced fractures along the thickness of the reservoir is depicted in FIG.
        3.  As FIG. 3 illustrates, the fractures 32 intercept a major portion of the
        lenticular sands 11 that are in the vicinity of\nthe wellbore.  Because the
        fractures extend uniformly down well 30 through the entire thickness 14 of
        reservoir 10, they are highly effective in recovering a large percentage of
        the gas trapped in the lenticular sands.  To compare potential recoveries,
        a\ntypical Piceance basin MHF well previously described in FIG. 2 will likely
        drain about 0.57 million cubic meters (0.20 to 0.30 Bcf) over the life of
        the well.  In contrast, a single multi-stage fractured well shown in FIG.
        3 drilled into the same\nlocation of the reservoir would likely recover in
        excess of 10 times more gas.\n<BR><BR>Although the OF well has only one long
        fracture in contrast to the approximately 30-50 fractures of the multi-stage
        fracture well, the MHF well often consumes more proppant in generating and
        propping open its single fracture.  For example, a MHF\nwell of the type illustrated
        in FIG. 2 would use up to about 0.91 million kg (3 million lbs) of sand proppant
        whereas the multiple fractures of the multi-stage fracture well on 15 acre
        spacing would consume only about one third that amount of proppant.\n<BR><BR>Another
        preferred embodiment of the present invention is directed at modifying fracture
        length based upon the relationship of the orientation of the fractures and
        the orientation of the sand lenses in the reservoir.  As noted above, the
        base\napproach is to generate total fracture lengths which approximate the
        average diameter of the lenticular sands found in the reservoir.  However,
        sand lenses are generally not circular in cross section, i.e., in the shape
        of a round lens.  Because their\ngeologic derivation are fluvial sands from
        the bends of ancient rivers, the lens shape may be elliptical or rectangular,
        with a much longer length than width.  (Other, more complex shapes, such as
        horseshoes or boomerang shapes, are also possible.)\n<BR><BR>FIGS. 4A through
        4E illustrate various combinations of sand lens and fracture orientations
        and how fracture length may be optimized based upon these orientations.  (In
        general, in a hydraulically fractured tight gas lens, the areal drainage\npattern
        of the fracture has an elliptical shape with the bi-wing fracture along the
        major axis of the ellipse.  The discussion which follows can be best understood
        with this drainage pattern in mind.) For the purpose of simplification, only
        a top view of\ntwo overlapping sand lenses (i.e., at different depths) are
        depicted in the figures, each being rectangular in shape with a length equal
        to four times the width.  The wells 40 are centered within the sand lenses
        and the fractures all have the same\norientation 41 (left-right).  (Fracture
        orientation will generally align in a direction that is perpendicular to the
        minimum principal stress of the formation although other factors may also
        influence direction.) FIG. 4A illustrates a situation where the\ntwo sand
        lenses 42A and 42A' are aligned and are perpendicular to the fracture orientation
        41.  Because of this orientation it is preferable to limit the propped fractures
        43A to a length (i.e., the bi-wing fracture length) that approximates the
        width 44\nof the sand lenses.  Fractures any longer than width 44 would penetrate
        non-productive formation and would not recover any additional gas.  FIG. 4B
        shows the sand lenses 42B and 42B' in the same parallel alignment with fracture
        orientation 41.  In this\ncase it is desirable to generate longer bi-wing
        fractures 43B that traverse the entire length 45 of the sand lenses.  These
        fractures would therefore have a desired length of four times the length of
        fractures 43A shown in FIG. 4A.  Fractures 43B shorter\nthan length 45 would
        not penetrate the entire sand lens and would not recover the maximum amount
        of recoverable gas.\n<BR><BR>FIGS. 4C and 4D illustrate more probable scenarios
        where the sand lenses are not in alignment.  In FIG. 4C, lens 42C is perpendicular
        to fracture orientation 41 but lens 42C' is at an angle 45.degree.  out of
        alignment with lens 42C.  In FIG. 4D,\nlens 42D is parallel with fracture
        orientation 41 and lens 42D's is in the same orientation as lens 42C'.  Determining
        the average distance across each lens along the direction of the fracture
        orientation yields the desired fracture length.  For example,\nin FIG. 4D
        the average consists of the length 45 of sand lens 42D plus the diagonal length
        46 traversed across lens 42D' by fracture orientation 41; divided by two.
        \ The calculated fracture length for fracture 43D is 3/4 (0.75) of length
        45.  In the case\nof FIG. 4C, the fractures 43C calculate to 1.5 times width
        44 (or 0.375 of length 45).\n<BR><BR>The final illustration, FIG. 4E, represents
        the two lenses 42E and 42E' that are perpendicular to one another, with one
        lens 42E being parallel to fracture orientation 41.  In this example, the
        preferred length for fractures 43E is twice width 44\n(or one half length
        45).  The outcome in FIG. 4E also reflects the fracture length which would
        be chosen if there were numerous sand lenses that had a random orientation;
        i.e., the fracture length is simply the average of the length and width of
        the\ntypical sand lens.  Also in situations where minimal information may
        be known about lens orientation (e.g., when the first well is drilled), one
        skilled in the art would select a fracture length that best approximates the
        average lens size.  As more\ninformation is gathered about lens orientation
        (e.g., additional wells drilled) the calculation of fracture length can become
        more refined and tailored to the types of situations depicted in FIG. 4.\n<BR><BR>Those
        skilled in the art will also understand that the sand lenses will generally
        not be neatly centered around the wellbore as illustrated in FIG. 4.  In most
        situations, the sand lenses will be off center.  (See, for example, how sand
        lenses 11\nare depicted in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3.) For example, if the wellbore
        40 in FIG. 4B was further to the right (i.e., off center but still aligned
        with fracture orientation 41) then fracture length 43B would not traverse
        the entire length of the sand lenses 42B\nand 42B's to the left of the wellbore
        and would extend beyond the sand lenses into unproductive formation to the
        right of the wellbore.  Nevertheless, the fracture would intersect a substantial
        portion of the lens and the lens would be effectively\ndrained.\n<BR><BR>The
        point of this discussion is to demonstrate that even with substantial knowledge
        of lens and fracture orientation, the selection of a total fracture length
        is still, at best, an approximation.  Thus in the practice of the present
        invention all\nreferences to fracture length, drainage area, sand lens size,
        well spacing and the like are intended as rough approximations that are subject
        to a wide range of variability.  Those skilled in the art will be able to
        most effectively practice the present\ninvention by working from pre-existing
        seismic and reservoir information plus data and analyses that are generated
        as the reservoir is developed.  In other words, there is expected to be a
        learning curve from reservoir development which will enable\nskilled practitioners
        to optimize the application of the present invention for specific basins and
        reservoirs.\n<BR><BR>The technique employed in the present invention for multi-stage
        fracturing uses ball sealers to divert a fracturing fluid through the targeted
        perforations.  Preferably the frac fluid is a non-Newtonian fluid such as
        cross-linked, gelled water. \nOther non-Newtonian fluids such as carbon dioxide
        foam or Newtonian fluids such as oil or water could also be employed to fracture
        the well.  However, cross-linked, gelled water is preferred given the lower
        costs, simplicity, and fluid properties that\nminimize problems with ball
        sealer migration upward (buoyant) or downward (non-buoyant) in the pad stage
        where the balls are dropped.  The technique employs ball sealers to sequentially
        seal off perforated intervals between stages because ball sealers\ncan be
        deployed much more rapidly and efficiently than mechanically isolating each
        interval.  For example, using ball sealers allows the well to be fully stimulated
        in about 4 days rather than the 40 days it would take to accomplish the same
        result using\ncostly mechanical isolation means.\n<BR><BR>The next sequence
        of figures describe the well completion and stimulation technique that is
        preferably employed to practice the present invention.  FIGS. 5A through SC
        illustrate the perforation locations in the well that are needed before\nfracturing
        commences.  Starting with FIG. 5A, the wellbore casing 50 is shown penetrating
        the entire thickness 52 of the reservoir.  The discontinuity 53 indicates
        that most of the wellbore is not shown; only the uppermost and lowermost portions
        being\ndepicted.  In the example shown, the reservoir has a total thickness
        of 1,220 meters (4,000 ft) and is divided into multi-stage zones, each zone
        having a thickness of about 305 m (1,000 ft).  FIG. 5A shows the top zone
        54 and the bottom zone 55 of the\nwell.  These zones are referred to herein
        as multi-stage zones and they reflect the practical limitation on the number
        (about 10) of ball sealer stages that can be usually conducted in a single
        day of treatment.  Thus, to treat all 1,220 m (4,000 ft) of\nreservoir would
        require four multi-stage (10 stages) jobs done sequentially on the wellbore
        starting with the deepest zone 55 and progressing to the shallowest multi-stage
        zone 54.  Each multi-stage zone is further subdivided into smaller intervals
        of\nabout 30 m (100 ft) each of which is referred to herein as a single-stage
        zone.  Intervals 56A-J associated with multi-stage zone 54 and intervals 57A-J
        associated with multi-stage zone 55 shown in FIG. 5A are single-stage zones.\n<BR><BR>A
        single-stage zone, 56I, is enlarged and shown in FIG. 5B.  A 3 m (10 ft) perforated
        interval 58 is selected as the location within interval 561 to be perforated.
        \ The perforated interval height is preferentially placed at the approximate\ngeometric
        center of each single-stage zone, but is not restricted to exactly that location.
        \ When actual sand lenses are located within 3 to 6 m (10 to 20 ft) of the
        preferred center location of the perforated interval height, the perforated
        interval\nheight can be moved to center on that nearby sand lens.  Although
        advantageous to have perforation holes approximately opposite a sand lens
        location when possible, it is not necessary to have the perforations at such
        a location for the application of\nthis invention.  Movement of the location
        of the perforated interval height more than 6 m (20 ft) from the preferred
        location can jeopardize the ability of the ball sealers to efficiently generate
        single-stage fracture heights that do not substantially\noverlap.  Although
        some overlap of fracture heights may occur without being detrimental to the
        practice of the invention, it is preferred that such overlap be minimized.
        \ FIG. 5C further enlarges the perforated interval 58 of the wellbore to illustrate\nthe
        location of the perforations 59 to be made within interval 58 and which penetrate
        wellbore casing 50.  FIG. 5C illustrates perforations 59 spaced apart by about
        0.3 m (1 ft) along interval 58 which is typically 3 m (10 ft); i.e. 10 perforation
        shots\nin vertical alignment along the casing within a 3 m (10 ft) perforated
        interval.  When viewed in its entirety in FIG. 5A, the wellbore casing has
        been perforated in 30 m (100 ft) single-stage zones, the perforations being
        centered about midway within a 3\nm (10 ft) perforated interval within each
        single-stage zone.\n<BR><BR>It is important to note that the selection of
        the perforation locations is mostly a geometric exercise that is only slightly
        influenced by the location of the lenticular sands in the formation.  This
        approach is very different than most\nperforating jobs that precede hydraulic
        fracturing of a well.  In perforating conventional wells the perforations
        are usually targeted to align with the productive formation sands of the reservoir.
        \ In the present invention the perforations are\nstrategically spaced along
        the entire thickness of the reservoir, preferably being located in short perforated
        interval heights that are within equally spaced single-stage heights along
        the wellbore as shown in FIG. 5A.\n<BR><BR>The number of single-stage zones,
        their vertical extent, the height of the perforated interval within the single-stage
        zones and the number of perforations can be varied and the example depicted
        in FIGS. 5A-5C are illustrative of only one\npossible scenario.  It is also
        possible that the length of the single-stage zones and perforated intervals
        and the number of perforations within a perforated interval can be altered
        within a single wellbore.  The most important factor influencing these\nvariables
        (single-stage fracture height, perforated interval height, and number of perforations)
        is the anticipated fracture height generated during the multi-stage hydraulic
        fracturing process.  There are a number of factors influencing fracture height\nincluding
        the stress patterns in the reservoir and discontinuities such as slip zones
        and natural fractures which may occur in both the gas bearing lenticular sands
        and the non-productive formation rock in which the sand lenses are dispersed.\n<BR><BR>It
        has been found that most hydraulic fractures, regardless of the fracture length,
        generate fracture heights that are in the range of 15 to 60 m (50 to 200 ft).
        \ For many parts of the Rocky Mountain basins having stacked lenticular sands,
        a good\nrule of thumb is that fracture height will be approximately 30 m (100
        ft).  To generate such a fracture height, one does not have to perforate the
        entire anticipated height of the fracture.  Instead it is preferable to only
        perforate the center portion\nof the fracture interval through which the fracturing
        fluids will enter.  Therefore, as discussed in connection with FIGS. 5A-5C,
        a perforated interval spacing distance of 30 m (100 ft) was selected which
        was typical of the average fracture height\nanticipated for the reservoir.
        \ The selection of a 3 m (10 ft) perforated interval with 10 vertically spaced
        perforations would enable the fracturing fluid to efficiently propagate a
        vertical fracture spreading out from the center of the interval and\ntraversing
        with the single-stage height out to the drainage radius.\n<BR><BR>The perforated
        interval spacing distance in general depends upon many reservoir and geological
        factors in a complex way, however there is a current field-derived correlation
        for the four Western Tight Gas basins previously discussed.  Plotted in\nFIG.
        6 are measured field fracture heights versus frac fluid volume injected which
        shows that in these basins fracture height increases with increased fluid
        volume.  If the average lens size in connection with the wellbore is greater,
        more fluid volume\nmust be injected to place a propped fracture to the drainage
        radius.  This increases fracture height and correspondingly increases the
        preferred perforated interval spacing to maintain separate single-stage fracture
        heights.  FIG. 7 is a correlation of\nthe preferred perforated interval spacing
        distance versus the average lens size which is developed from the curve shown
        in FIG. 6.  It is anticipated that once average lens size is determined in
        an area by logging, conventional reservoir interference\ntesting, or other
        means, perforated interval spacing distance would be determined from a plot
        similar to FIG. 7 for the completion of nearby, new wells.  FIG. 7 may not
        be specifically applicable to all areas in the Western Tight Gas basins and
        may not\napply to other basins around the world.  However, it is expected
        that the same methodology used to generate FIG. 7 would apply to other lenticular,
        gas-bearing reservoirs in the world with different input from those reservoirs
        equivalent to FIG. 6.\n<BR><BR>The process for controlling the fracturing
        of all of the intervals in the well involves the multi-stage fracturing technique
        using ball sealers.  The multi-stage fracturing preferably starts with the
        bottom multi-stage zone in the reservoir and\nworks its way up to the top
        multi-stage zone.  (Recalling FIG. 5A, the bottom zone 55 would be the first
        fractured and the top zone 54 would be last.) The zone being fractured can
        be isolated from the deeper multi-stage zones in the wellbore that have\nbeen
        already fractured by placement of a sand plug (or mechanical bridge plug)
        inside the casing.  Within each multi-stage zone, the single-stage zones are
        sequentially fractured until all intervals in the zone have been fractured.
        \ It is not necessary\nthat the single-stage zones fracture in any particular
        order (for example, from top to bottom or bottom to top).  In fact, the primary
        reason for selecting essentially equally spaced perforated intervals which
        each have the same number of perforations is\nso that it does not make any
        difference which order the single-stage zones are fractured.  The technique
        then moves up the wellbore to the next multi-stage zone where all single-stage
        zones are also fractured and, so forth, until every single-stage zone\nis
        fractured.\n<BR><BR>Within each multi-stage zone, fracturing from one single-stage
        zone to the next single-stage zone occurs in the manner shown in FIGS. 8A-8C.
        \ In FIG. 8A, fracturing fluid is injected into wellbore 60 and down to a
        single-stage zone 62A through\ntubing set on a packer 65 or alternatively
        without a packer with perforations 64 that are approximately centered on the
        single-stage zone.  The fracturing fluid 63, preferably a non-Newtonian cross-linked
        gelled water containing proppant, enters the\nformation through perforations
        64.  Because the shallowest single-stage zone 62A within multi-stage zone
        61 usually has lower stress than the deeper single-stage zone 62B, zone 62A
        is likely to fracture first as the injection pressure of the fracturing\nfluid
        increases.  Although this is the most likely scenario, a different order of
        single-stage zone fracturing will not alter the effectiveness of the overall
        multi-stage, ball-sealer staging process described in this invention.  Using
        procedures well\nknown in the art, a proppant such as sand is carried by the
        frac fluid and injected into the fracture.  The sand-laden fracturing fluid
        enters into the hydraulic fractures and serves to hold the fractures in an
        open position after the hydraulic pressure\nof the fracturing fluid is reduced
        and the fluid is recovered.\n<BR><BR>As shown in FIG. 8A ball sealers 66 are
        generally injected into the well in the pad stage after the end of the proppant-laden
        fracturing fluid of an individual single-stage zone so that they arrive at
        the particular single-stage zone being\nfractured at the correct time.  Critical
        to making this part of the technique work is to drop the ball sealers at the
        correct time before or after the proppant-laden fluid stage 63.  The balls,
        typically having a specific gravity of 0.9 to 1.5, may\nascend (if buoyant)
        or descend (if non-buoyant) within the pad fluid and can arrive at the perforations
        too late or too early.  If necessary, the injection time of the ball sealers
        is altered so as to have the balls arrive at the perforated interval of\nthe
        single-stage zone at the right time.  FIG. 8B shows the balls seated on perforations
        64 in perforated interval 62A, having arrived at the correct time thereby
        sealing off that single-stage fracture zone.  If the balls arrive too soon,
        they can seal\nthe perforations before all the sand is injected, resulting
        in fracture initiation of a lower interval by sand-laden fluid.  The result
        would be that the next stage of pad fluid pumped into the next single-stage
        zone would contain a small spearhead of\nproppant-laden fluid that would likely
        screen out that single-stage zone, preventing further treatment of the multi-stage
        zone.\n<BR><BR>By timing the ball sealer injection properly, as described
        above, the first single-stage zone in the multi-stage zone is sealed.  Referring
        to FIG. 8C, after perforations 64 are sealed, a pad fluid 67 that does not
        contain proppant is injected\nwhich initiates the fracturing of the next single-stage
        zone (most likely interval 62B).  The process is then repeated using proppant
        and timed ball sealer injection until that interval is fractured and sealed.
        \ Thus in a controlled multi-stage\nfracturing process each single-stage zone
        within each multi-stage zone is stimulated.\n<BR><BR>The fracturing technique
        is also controlled to limit the propped total fracture length.  A specific
        volume of fracturing fluid and sand is injected into each single-stage zone.
        \ Instead of the 1.38 million kg (3 million lbs) of sand typical of\nMHF well
        injection, only about 11,340 kg (25,000 lbs) of sand are typically injected
        into the formation surrounding each single-stage fracture zone if the average
        sand lens size is approximately 15 acres.  The entire well, having 40 fractured
        intervals\nconsumes about 0.45 million kg (1 million lbs) of sand.  The controlled
        propped fracture lengths have a radial distance away from the wellbore of
        about 122 m (400 ft) which laterally extends from the wellbore into the formation.\n<BR><BR>The
        final outcome of part of a multi-stage zone that has been fractured is depicted
        in FIG. 9.  Surrounding wellbore 70 are three single-stage zones which have
        been perforated (perforations 71) and successfully fractured with the multi-stage\ntechnique
        using ball sealers described above.  Each of the single-stage fracture wings
        72 extend laterally, approximately 122 m (400 ft) into single-stage fracture
        zones 73 A, B, and C; thereby opening to the wellbore, flow from a reservoir
        area having a\nhorizontal area spacing of about 60,700 m.sup.2 (15 acres).
        \ This lateral extent 74 of the bi-wing fractures reaches the approximate
        average area of the lenticular sands 76 contained in the reservoir.  The single-stage
        zone's fracture height of about 30\nm (100 ft) puts those sand lenses above
        and below the perforated interval height into communication with the wellbore,
        as shown by dotted line 75, that is within the formation surrounding the perforated
        interval.\n<BR><BR>After all fracturing operations are completed, a continuous
        span of hydraulically fractured reservoir formation extends through the entire
        thickness of the formation that surrounds the wellbore.  This fracturing technique
        is intended to intercept\nand stimulate a major portion of the lenticular
        sands that are either intersected by the wellbore or within the drainage radius
        of the well.  Gas trapped in these sands will therefore flow into the generated
        hydraulic fractures and cumulatively will\nproduce a large volume of gas that
        effectively drains the lenticular sands.\n<BR><BR>The preferred method for
        practicing the present invention involves coupling the multi-stage fracturing
        technique with a system for locating and spacing the wells within the reservoir.
        \ Although the method of the present invention can be practiced\nby drilling
        a single well in a prime area of a reservoir where a large concentration of
        quality sands are present, the method is best practiced by drilling multiple
        wells which fully develop the entire reservoir or a substantial portion of
        it.  The\nmulti-stage fracturing technique generates lateral fractures that
        have an areal influence of about 40,500 to 121,400 m.sup.2 (10 to 30 acres).
        \ Within this range the wells will effectively drain the adjacent and near-wellbore
        lenticular sands, i.e., the\nsand lenses in the vicinity of the well.  Outside
        the fracture radius, the sand lenses will not be intercepted and will not
        be drained.\n<BR><BR>FIG. 10A shows a horizontal section (slice) of reservoir
        80.  This section contains three wells 81, 82, 83 that have been drilled into
        the reservoir and fractured by the multi-stage fracturing technique of the
        present invention.  The section\ncould be a single 100 ft slice representing
        one single-stage height of the well.  The section also intercepts several
        lenses 95 of productive sand that are within this slice of the reservoir.
        \ Because only three wells are drilled into the reservoir, a\nnumber of the
        sand lenses are not intercepted by the fracture zone 96 of the wells.\n<BR><BR>To
        complete development of the reservoir, additional wells need to be drilled
        down to a spacing that is approximately equal to the effective drainage area
        of each well, i.e., 40,500 to 121,400 m.sup.2 (10 to 30 acres).  This effective
        drainage\narea also approximates the average area of the sand lenses in the
        vicinity of the wells.  Drainage area of the wells refers to the cross-sectional
        area surrounding the wells within the reservoir which may not be the same
        as the surface area spacing.  For\nexample, it may be possible to more efficiently
        drill multiple directional wells from a single drilling site on the surface.
        \ It is anticipated that for many of the reservoirs in the Rocky Mountain
        basins the effective drainage area will be about 81,000\nm.sup.2 (20 acres)
        or less.  Thus to fully exploit these lenticular sand reservoirs the bottomhole
        location of the wells should be spaced to approximate the drainage area of
        the well and the approximate average size of the sand lenses.  FIG. 10B depicts\nthe
        same reservoir cross-section 80 with 17 wells 101 to 117 properly spaced such
        that the collective drainage area of the wells covers nearly all of the reservoir.\n<BR><BR>With
        the field fully developed, substantially all of the lenticular sands are intercepted
        by the fracture zone 96 (depicted as circles) of at least one of the wells
        and the sands will therefore be productively drained.  By developing the\nreservoir
        in this manner it is theoretically possible to intercept most of the lenticular
        sands 96 contained within the thickness of the reservoir.  Because reservoir
        sands and properties and induced fracture mechanics can have a high level
        of\nvariability, interception of all of the sand lenses may not be achieved
        in actual reservoir applications.  Nevertheless the method of the present
        invention should result in a major portion of the reservoir lenticular sands
        being intercepted and drained\nprovided the controlled multi-stage fracturing
        and proper well spacing described herein is performed.\n<BR><BR>The spacing
        of the wells within the reservoir should not be less than the approximate
        average cross-sectional area of the lenticular sands to which the lateral
        fractures have been roughly matched.  Denser spacing beyond that described
        herein\nwould be detrimental by creating unnecessary interference, overlapping
        drainage among wells, and increasing costs.  Such excess drilling would not
        generate any additional gas overall and, in fact, may be counter productive
        to the controlled fracturing\ndescribed herein.  Therefore well spacing should
        not be less than the approximate average cross-sectional drainage area of
        the lenticular gas-bearing deposits.  Alternatively, the approximate average
        drainage area of the lateral fractures along the\nlength of the well should
        not be greater than the average cross-sectional area of the sand lenses in
        the vicinity of each well.\n<BR><BR>Much of the description of the method
        of the present invention relates to specific examples or illustrations.  For
        example, controlling the lateral well fractures to drain an area of 40,500
        to 121,400 m.sup.2 (10 to 30 acres) is intended to\nintercept the lenticular
        sands in the vicinity of the well whose areal extent averages about the same
        size.  Those skilled in the art of hydraulic fracturing and in the geology
        of lenticular hydrocarbon deposits will recognize that these illustrations\nare
        rough, idealistic approximations of the actual practice of the present invention.
        \ Geologists and reservoir engineers will recognize that the size, shape,
        distribution and physical properties of the lenticular deposits and surrounding
        formation will\nvary significantly even in well-defined basins.  The Rocky
        Mountain region is one of geological variability and there is a high degree
        of discontinuity and unpredictability.  Similarly, hydraulic fracturing is
        not as readily predictable or controllable\nbecause the induced fractures
        will encounter different types of formation rock besides the targeted sands.\n<BR><BR>There
        are also many natural fractures in these types of reservoir which further
        generate unpredictable results.\n<BR><BR>Those skilled in the art will therefore
        recognize that the \"controlled\" multi-stage fracturing method described
        herein is not precise and is an attempt to create a fracture which approximates
        the average size of the lenticular deposits near the\nwellbore.  Therefore,
        limitations of precise measurement of fracture size, areal extent of the lenticular
        deposits, well-spacing and the like should not be read into the present invention.
        \ Instead the present invention is directed at approximating these\ninterrelated
        variables using the information available to the practitioner.  Using the
        information at hand and information which becomes available as wells are drilled
        during reservoir development, those skilled in the art will be able to use
        the present\ninvention to economically exploit the heretofore non-commercial
        lenticular gas deposits of the Rocky Mountain region and other areas of the
        world where such deposits are found.\n<BR><BR><CENTER><b>* * * * *</b></CENTER>\n<HR>\n
