        ball recharging apparatus method\n</FONT><BR>\n       <BR><CENTER><b>Abstract</b></CENTER>\n
        \      <p> A method and apparatus for recharging depleted tennis balls that
        uses\n     compressed carbon dioxide. A recharge pressure vessel including
        a\n     cylinder with a closed end and a spaced apart open end with a connecting\n
        \    wall forming a charging chamber. A pressure port proximate the open end\n
        \    permits gas entry and exit for charging. The chamber may be filled with\n
        \    any number of discharged tennis balls and then is sealed and charged
        with\n     high pressure heavy molecular weight gas such as carbon dioxide.
        The\n     vessel is then agitated to jostle the inserted balls and within
        4 to 5\n     days, the balls will become fully pressurized and the pressure
        may be\n     released and the recharged balls remove from the vessel.\n</p>\n

        OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR> 1.  Field of the Invention\n<BR><BR> The present
        invention relates to the field of recharging depleted or exhausted or dead
        or depressurized tennis balls.  In particular, the present invention relates
        specifically to an apparatus and method for recharging depleted or exhausted
        or\ndead or depressurized tennis balls to restore the liveliness and optimum
        configuration of the individual balls.  Known art may be found in U.S.  Class
        206, subclass 213.1 as well as in other classes and subclasses.\n<BR><BR>
        2.  Description of the Known Art\n<BR><BR> Many games use a gas pressurized
        hollow ball during play (i.e. football, basketball, soccer, tennis, etc.).
        \ In the game of tennis, the ball is spherical and of a standard diameter
        and it is covered with a fibrous nap.  Important parameters of\nthe tennis
        ball are its bounce or liveliness or resiliency and this is a function of
        the ball's internal gas pressure, its size and spherical configuration and
        the condition of the fibrous nap.  All of these parameters should be maintained
        constant and\nuniform from ball to ball and during the useful life of the
        ball.  Since the reaction of the ball to the impact of the racket and its
        ground rebound characteristics are functions of the above parameters, any
        significant change or variation thereof\nadversely affects the proper playing
        of the game.\n<BR><BR> As is well known, the resiliency exhibited by tennis
        balls is due, at least in part, to the pressurization of the tennis balls
        during manufacturing.  To be suitable for tournament play, tennis balls must
        be able to meet quite rigid\nspecifications regarding their size, the distance
        to which they rebound when dropped from a standard height, the amount of deformation
        they exhibit under an applied standard force, and their surface characteristics.
        \ All manufacturers strive to comply\nwith these rigid specifications to insure
        that the balls they manufacture exhibit the uniformity demanded by serious
        amateur as well as professional tennis competitors.\n<BR><BR> Tennis balls
        are generally packaged and marketed in pressurized hermetically sealed containers
        so as to minimize or prevent any diffusion outwardly of the pressurized gas
        in the ball which would reduce its liveliness and so as to obviate any\ndistortion
        of the ball from its standard size or shape as a consequence of the ball's
        high internal pressure.  A basic problem with tennis balls presently in use
        is that, as the balls age, they lose pressure.  This pressure loss results
        from the\ndiffusion through the tennis ball surface of whatever gas may be
        used to inflate tennis balls during manufacture.  Partially to combat this
        loss of pressure, tennis balls have, for some time, been marketed in pressurized
        canisters, generally three tennis\nballs to a canister.  Of course, once the
        canister in which the tennis balls have been sold is opened, the tennis balls
        are removed from their pressurized environment and, as a result of the pressure
        differential across their surfaces, they begin to be\ndeflated and the distortion
        of the ball commences so that the ball is thereafter of limited useful life
        in the proper playing of tennis.\n<BR><BR> As stated previously, with usage
        and/or the passage of time, the internal pressurization of tennis balls eventually
        escapes until the internal pressure of the tennis balls drops to atmospheric
        pressure.  At that time, the unpressurized and\ndepleted tennis balls are
        considered to be dead or flat even though their the tennis balls may otherwise
        be acceptable.  Depleted tennis balls are typically discarded.  While many
        of the tennis balls may be retired because their surfaces have become worn\nbeyond
        acceptable limits, many more tennis balls are retired simply because they
        have lost their pressurization.  Discarding depleted but otherwise acceptable
        tennis balls can be extremely wasteful, particularly at large clubs such as
        tennis clubs and\ncountry clubs where the quantity of depleted tennis balls
        can be high.\n<BR><BR> Others have proposed solutions to deal with depleted
        tennis balls, including recharging and/or recycling apparatus and methods.

        has an internal bevel at one end which cuts a plug from the wall of the ball.
        \ The plug seats into the needle and is partially\nexposed beyond the end
        of the needle.  Gas is released from the pressure source and passes through
        the needle to enter into the ball through a side vent in the needle.  As the
        needle is withdrawn from the ball after it is repressurized, the plug engages\nin
        and seals the puncture hole.\n<BR><BR> Many of the preceding devices are either
        complex and inconvenient to employ or they have been unsatisfactory in that
        they tended to damage the surface of the ball, thereby adversely affecting
        the ball's playing properties and otherwise left much\nto be desired.\n<BR><BR>
        Another significant drawback of the prior art is that such prior art contemplates
        pressurization of a very small number of tennis balls, typically, three tennis
        balls in a container of a configuration similar to the containers in which
        tennis\nballs are marketed.\n<BR><BR> The increasing popularity of tennis
        and the resultant growth in the offering of group tennis lessons, as well
        as the burgeoning tennis club industry, have resulted in the use of far more
        tennis balls than such prior art apparatus can\neconomically preserve.  For
        example, it is not uncommon for a tennis club in a large metropolitan area
        to use 10,000 or more tennis balls in a year.  To address the large quantities
        of balls, some have proposed \"batch\" systems.  \"Batch\" processing of\ntennis
        balls can be a real and immediate solution that may result in significant
        economy, particularly for users of large numbers of tennis balls.  As used
        by many, batch processing refers to the processing of, for example, 200 or
        more tennis balls at\none time.\n<BR><BR> For example, U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,101,029

        pressure storage chamber integrally and unitarily housed within a single tank
        and separated by a bulkhead.  An air compressor is connected to the high pressure\nreservoir
        and is controlled by a gauge apparatus to maintain a desired high pressure
        within the reservoir.  The reservoir and storage chamber are connected together
        by a conduit which includes a low pressure regulator to maintain a desired
        pressure in\nthe storage chamber.  A passageway with an air-tight, removable
        lid provides access to the interior of the low pressure chamber for loading
        and unloading the tennis balls.  The apparatus may also be used to repressurize
        tennis balls which have lost some\nof their inflation with compressed air.\n<BR><BR>
        The known art fails to address many perceived shortcomings in the industry.
        \ For example, a desirable improvement in the art would be the introduction
        of a system adapted to quickly recharge depleted tennis balls economically
        and efficiently\nwall also providing the ability to store tennis balls indefinitely.\n<BR><BR>
        Thus, it may be seen that these prior art patents are very limited in their
        teaching and utilization, and an improved method and apparatus for effectively
        recharging tennis balls and particularly large quantities of tennis balls
        quickly is\nneeded to overcome these limitations.  What is needed then is
        an improved apparatus and method for quickly recharging large quantities of
        depleted tennis balls in an efficient and economical manner.\n<BR><BR>SUMMARY
        OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR> The present invention is directed to an improved
        apparatus and method for quickly recharging large quantities of depleted tennis
        balls in an efficient and economical manner.  In accordance with one exemplary
        embodiment of the present invention,\na method and apparatus for recharging
        depleted tennis balls is provided that uses compressed carbon dioxide.  Of
        particular note is the invention's ability to quickly and economically recharge
        balls.  The invention may advantageously utilize multiple\npressure vessels
        to permit a user to simultaneously recharge and store recharged balls.  The
        multiple pressure vessels may be arranged to discharge gases from a recharging
        vessel at high-pressure into a storage vessel maintained at a lower pressure.
        \ In\nthis manner, gas may be recycled by moving it from a high pressure vessel
        to a low pressure vessel before discharge.  High-pressure gas may also be
        recycled by moving it from a recharge vessel into another recharge vessel
        to partially charge the new\nrecharge vessel.\n<BR><BR> In one exemplary embodiment
        of the invention, a recharge pressure vessel is filled with any number of
        discharged, flat tennis balls.  The vessel is sealed and charged with 50 psi
        of carbon dioxide.  The vessel is then rotated to dislodge any\nballs that
        may have been wedged into the side of the vessel to prevent wedged balls from
        becoming misshapen.  The vessel is rotated periodically to maintain the desired
        ball shape.  Within 4 to 5 days, the balls become fully pressurized and the
        pressure\nmay be released and the recharged balls remove from the vessel.
        \ It is possible to recharge the balls at a pressure as low as 20 psi, but
        such a lower pressure increases the charging time to 6 weeks or longer.  Thus,
        higher pressures exponentially\ndecrease the charging time.\n<BR><BR> It is
        thus an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and process
        that can be economically operated to batch process tennis balls in order to
        restore a desirable internal pressurization, thereby significantly increasing
        the\nuseful life of the tennis balls.\n<BR><BR> It is a basic object of the
        present invention to provide an apparatus and method which may be used to
        repressurize tennis balls which have lost a significant amount of their original
        pressurization.\n<BR><BR> An additional object of the present invention is
        to provide an apparatus for storing tennis balls in a pressurized environment
        to preserve their pressurization wherein the apparatus is proportioned and
        designed for bulk processing of tennis\nballs and sufficient to maintain constant
        pressure for such batch processing.\n<BR><BR> It is a principal object of
        the present invention to provide an improved device for preserving the playing
        characteristics of an internally gas pressurized ball.\n<BR><BR> Another object
        of the present invention is to provide an improved vessel for preserving the
        playing characteristics of a supply of internally gas pressurized balls during
        the prolonged storage thereof.\n<BR><BR> Still another object of the present
        invention is to provide an improved pressure vessel for storing a supply of
        gas pressurized balls, such as tennis balls and the like, to preserve their
        original liveliness, bounce, configuration and shape.\n<BR><BR> Still a further
        object of the present invention is to provide an improved vessel of the above
        nature characterized by its simplicity, ruggedness, reliability, ease and
        convenience of use and application, and great versatility and adaptability.\n<BR><BR>
        These and other objects and advantages of the present invention, along with
        features of novelty appurtenant thereto, will appear or become apparent by
        reviewing the following detailed description of the invention. <BR><BR>BRIEF
        DESCRIPTION OF\nTHE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS\n<BR><BR> In the following
        drawings, which form a part of the specification and which are to be construed
        in conjunction therewith, and in which like reference numerals have been employed
        throughout wherever possible to indicate like parts in the various\nviews:\n<BR><BR>
        FIG. 1 is a schematic view of a recharging system in accordance with an exemplary
        embodiment of the invention; and,\n<BR><BR> FIG. 2 is a partially fragmented
        perspective view of a recharging tank showing several tennis balls being recharged
        therein.\n<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR> As shown
        in FIG. 1 of the drawings, one exemplary embodiment of the present invention
        is generally designated by reference numeral 20.  The present invention employs
        a cylindrical pressure vessel 22 with an internal charging chamber 24 that
        is\nessentially impermeable when sealed.\n<BR><BR> The chamber 24 is formed
        from the hollow vessel interior bounded between a closed end 26 and a spaced
        apart removable end 27 with a wall 28 extending therebetween.  The removable
        end 27 may include the entire cylinder end or a portion thereof. \nA charging
        port 29 penetrates vessel 22 proximate removable end 28.  The charging port
        29 permits the entry and removal of gasses from chamber 24.  A pressure gauge
        may penetrate vessel 22 adjacent port 29 or alternatively a removable pressure
        gauge may\nbe placed on port 29 during tennis ball charging to thereby measure
        the internal pressure in chamber 24.\n<BR><BR> The invention may include a
        series of storage vessels 23 that are virtually identical to pressure vessel
        22.  The storage vessels may be appropriately plumbed to reuse gas released
        from the charging vessel 22 or they may be supplied with gas\nseparately as
        appropriate.  Such storage vessels may be used to store recharged tennis balls
        at 17 psi indefinitely.\n<BR><BR> Of particular relevance to the present invention
        is Dalton's law.  It says the total pressure of a gas is equal to the sum
        of the partial pressures of each of the component gases: P.sub.total=P.sub.1+P.sub.2+P.sub.3
        .  . . +P.sub.n If we\nconsider air, this means the total atmospheric pressure
        of 1.013 bars (14.7 pounds per square inch absolute) is the sum of the partial
        pressures of all its constituents: nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, argon, carbon
        dioxide, and various other gases in\ntrace amounts.  In particular, air contains
        roughly 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and trace
        amounts of other gases, in addition to variable quantities of water vapor,
        which normally approximates 3%.  The two most dominant\ncomponents in dry
        air are Oxygen and Nitrogen.  Oxygen has an 16 atomic unit mass and Nitrogen
        has a 14 atomic units mass.  Since both these elements are diatomic in air
        --O.sub.2 and N.sub.2, the molecular mass of Oxygen is 32 and the molecular
        mass of\nNitrogen is 28.  Since air is a mixture of gases the total mass can
        be estimated by adding the weight of all major components as shown below:\n<BR><BR>

        of dry Air 28.97\n<BR><BR> Water vapor--H.sub.2O--is composed of one Oxygen
        atom and two Hydrogen atoms.  Hydrogen is the lightest element at 1 atomic
        unit while Oxygen is 16 atomic units.  Thus the water vapor atom has an atomic
        mass of 18 atomic units.  At 18 atomic\nunits, water vapor is lighter than
        diatomic Oxygen with 32 units and diatomic Nitrogen with 28 units.  Thus,
        it is important to note that water vapor in air will replace other gases and
        reduce the total density of the mixture and hence dry air is more\ndense than
        humid air.  Carbon dioxide (CO.sub.2) on the other hand has a atomic mass
        of 44.01, which is more dense than dry air at 28.97.\n<BR><BR> In the charging
        container 22, carbon dioxide is kept at 50 psi during charging.  The introduction
        of multiple depleted tennis balls 42 introduces a quantity of air at atmospheric
        pressure (i.e. air at approximately 14.7 psi).  The total quantity\nis dependent
        upon the number of tennis balls introduced but can be expected to be the number
        of tennis balls multiplied by the internal volume of each ball, which can
        be calculated based upon the formula: sphere volume= 4/3.pi.r.sup.3=(.pi.d.sup.3)/6.
        \nThe acceptable measurements for the external diameter of tennis balls according
        to the International Tennis Federation is 2.575 inches to 2.700 inches with
        the outer covering and internal rubber core having a thickness of approximated
        0.125 inches. \nThus, the appropriate diameter is approximately 2.5 inches
        and the internal volume of each ball is approximately 8.17 cubic inches.  Fifty
        such balls would have an internal volume of 408.5 cubic inches.  The charging
        chamber volume is much larger.\n<BR><BR> The volume of a cylinder can be calculated
        using the formula: Volume=.pi.r.sup.2height=1/4.pi.d.sup.2height.  In one
        exemplary embodiment, the charging chamber 24 has a radius of approximately
        4-6 inches and a height of approximately 2.5-3.0\nfeet (i.e. 30 inches).  Thus,
        the volume of the charging chamber would be approximately 3391 cubic inches.
        \ Such a charging chamber can hold 50 or more tennis balls.\n<BR><BR> Introducing
        50 flat tennis balls 32 at atmospheric pressure into the charging chamber
        does not change the pressure or gas concentrations inside the chamber, which
        is already at ambient room conditions.  After the balls are added, the pressure
        in\nthe charging chamber 25 is increased to 50 psi by introducing an appropriate
        quantity of pressurized carbon dioxide, generally in the range of 1-5 pounds
        of materials.  The added carbon dioxide initially fills the charging chamber
        24, increasing the\npressure throughout the charging container.  Each of the
        tennis balls 30 acts as a small pressure vessel with permeable walls that
        the pressurized carbon dioxide gas must permeate over time.  The internal
        pressure of each tennis ball is initially at 14.7\npsi (i.e. 1 atm) but over
        time the pressurized carbon dioxide at 50 psi will penetrate the tennis ball
        exterior 32 as well as the semi-permeable rubber core or internal wall 34
        and begin equalizing the internal tennis ball pressure with the chamber\ninternal
        pressure.  As the tennis ball pressure increases, the chamber pressure decreases
        accordingly.  After approximately 4 days, the internal tennis ball pressures
        will have risen to 17 psi while the chamber pressure will have decreased from
        50 to 47\npsi.  Thus it is possible to monitor the status of the charging
        tennis balls by monitoring the decreasing pressure of the charging chamber
        30 to determine when the balls are recharged.\n<BR><BR> It has been found
        that the number of tennis balls being recharged is not especially important
        in that 3 balls can be recharged in essentially the same time frame as 30
        balls.  However, increasing the internal pressure of the recharging chamber\nfrom
        50 to 60 psi did decrease the recharging time from 4 days to 3 days.\n<BR><BR>
        The steps for implementing the present invention include the following.  The
        chamber 24 is emptied and open and at ambient atmospheric condition.  Several
        depleted tennis balls (i.e. up to around 50) are then introduced into the
        chamber 24\nthrough the opened removable end 28.  End 28 is then sealed.  A
        gas preferably heavier in molecular weight than air and most preferentially
        carbon dioxide is introduced into the chamber 24 through port 29.  As additional
        gas is introduced, the pressure\ninside chamber 24 rises above 14 psi and
        then above 17 psi.  While feasible to operate at lower pressures, it has been
        determined through experimentation that practicable time periods (i.e. less
        than 10 days) requires a chamber pressure of at least 40\npsi and more preferentially
        50 psi.  Once the pressure chamber 24 is charged to 50 psi, the chamber may
        be agitated to jostle the balls 32 inside the chamber.  This prevents balls
        from becoming misshapen as a result of being lodged or otherwise\ncaptivated
        against a wall or the like.  The chamber pressure is monitored with a pressure
        gauge, which may be a permanent part of the vessel 22 or used with port 29.
        \ As the chamber pressure decreases, the pressure inside the balls will increase\ncorrespondingly.
        \ Once a desirable pressure decrease has occurred (i.e. 3 psi drop) a corresponding
        pressure increase in the balls will occur as well.  Thus, once the chamber
        pressure drops 3 psi the internal ball pressure will have risen from 14 to
        17\npsi and the balls will be sufficiently recharged to terminate the recharging
        process.  The pressure in chamber 22 is then bleed off through port 29 until
        at an acceptable level (i.e. 17 psi for storage and 14 psi to open the chamber).\n<BR><BR>
