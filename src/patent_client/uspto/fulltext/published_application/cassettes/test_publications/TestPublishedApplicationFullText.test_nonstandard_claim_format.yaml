        RELATED APPLICATIONS\n<BR><BR>[0001] This application is a non-provisional

        Applications Ser.\n     No. 62/305,758 filed Mar. 9, 2016, entitled \"LOW
        FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTED\n     ACOUSTIC SENSING,\" and Ser. No. 62/305,777 filed
        Mar. 9, 2016, entitled\n     \"PRODUCTION LOGS FROM DISTRIBUTED ACOUSTIC SENSORS,\"
        each of which is\n     incorporated herein in its entirety.\n       <BR><BR>FEDERALLY
        SPONSORED RESEARCH STATEMENT\n<BR><BR>[0002] Not applicable.\n<BR><BR>FIELD
        OF THE DISCLOSURE\n<BR><BR>[0003] The invention relates to drilling oil and
        gas wells, and in\n     particular to methods of well ranging using distributed
        acoustic sensors.\n<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE\n<BR><BR>[0004] In
        the oil and gas industry, \"well ranging\" or \"wellbore surveying\"\n     or
        \"borehole surveying\" is the art of determining exactly where an\n     underground
        well is so that the next well can either be intersected or\n     avoided,
        as needed.\n<BR><BR>[0005] Only under ideal conditions will the path of a
        drilled hole follow\n     the original dip (or inclination) and azimuth (or
        direction) established\n     at the top of the hole. It is more typical that
        the borehole will be\n     deflected from the intended direction as a result
        of layering in the\n     rock, the variation in the hardness of the layers,
        and the angle of the\n     drill bit relative to these layers.\n<BR><BR>[0006]
        Because one of the purposes of a borehole is to obtain information\n     in
        the third dimension--i.e. at depth--the location is just as important\n     as
        the information itself. Most often the information consists of the\n     geology
        of the drill core or assays of the core at selected depths. If\n     the hole
        has deviated significantly, then that information cannot be\n     properly
        assigned to a location in 3-dimensional space beneath the\n     earth's surface.
        Conclusions about geological structure or models of the\n     size, shape,
        tonnage and average grade of ore-bodies based on the\n     `mis-placed` information
        will be incorrect.\n<BR><BR>[0007] Furthermore, in crowded fields it may be
        necessary to avoid\n     drilling in already tapped payzones and/or to avoid
        existing wells.\n     Alternatively, it may be desired to intersect a given
        well at a\n     particular depth and angle. Indeed with unconventional oil
        development,\n     unusual well configurations are often needed to realize
        the value of a\n     play and may be the norm rather than the exception.\n<BR><BR>[0008]
        Thus, determining the distance and direction between wellbores is\n     critical
        in many applications. In addition to being used for relief-well\n     applications,
        parallel twinning for developments such as steam-assisted\n     gravity drainage
        (SAGD) and coalbed methane (CBM) horizontal-to-vertical\n     intersections
        use ranging technology. As more fields mature, ranging\n     technology can
        be used in other applications such as plug and abandonment\n     wells, frac
        recovery, and for in-fill applications where anti-collision\n     and relative
        wellbore positioning between multiple wells is of concern.\n<BR><BR>[0009]
        In the early years drilling was more of an art than a science. The\n     general
        principals of geology and exploration were understood and\n     followed,
        but the effects of formation changes and dip on bit deflection\n     and hence
        borehole trajectory were not clearly understood and largely\n     ignored.
        This perpetuated state of ignorance lead to many unresolved\n     lease disputes,
        where wells drilled and brought on stream, close to an\n     adjacent lease,
        would often result in diminished production rates on the\n     adjacent lease
        wells. However, wells already in production were cased and\n     the magnetic
        compass based survey instruments available could not provide\n     post-completion
        trajectory data. Throughout this time, many\n     inclination-only devices
        were developed, later versions of which were\n     accurate to 1 or 2 degrees
        throughout their operating range.\n<BR><BR>[0010] In 1929 gyroscopes were
        designed that would provide the inclination\n     of the borehole and the
        direction of that inclination within casing. The\n     first gyros used by
        the industry had no means of inner gimbal/spin axis\n     control, but the
        surveyor could determine its approximate position from\n     the film record
        at each survey station. These gyros were originally\n     intended for use
        up to 20-30 degrees inclination. However, as borehole\n     inclinations increased,
        hardware improvements were made and operational\n     techniques were developed
        that enabled these tools to be used\n     successfully beyond 60 degrees inclination.\n<BR><BR>[0011]
        Since then, numerous borehole surveying devices have been\n     developed,
        none of which are perfect. Reasonably accurate results are\n     possible
        by properly using the right tool in the right hole, but all\n     devices
        have their limitations. Surveying a borehole is usually\n     accomplished
        by moving a probe along the hole and sensing the movement of\n     the probe
        relative to one or more frames of reference, which may include\n     the earth's
        gravitational field, magnetic field or other inertial\n     reference, and/or
        by sensing the distortion or bending of the housing of\n     the probe itself.\n<BR><BR>[0012]
        Different methods have their own advantages and limitations. Some\n     have
        the ability to operate inside steel casing, and others cannot. Some\n     methods
        are time consuming and others are fast. Some are relatively\n     simple to
        use and others are complex to operate. Other considerations are\n     accuracy,
        cost, distance between measurements, ruggedness and\n     reliability.\n<BR><BR>[0013]
        Thus, there remains a continuing need in the art for ever-improved\n     borehole
        surveying methods, systems and devices to increase the accuracy\n     of borehole
        surveying. The ideal method would be fast, easy to use, and\n     cost effective,
        but without sacrificing accuracy, ruggedness and\n     reliability.\n<BR><BR>SUMMARY
        OF THE DISCLOSURE\n<BR><BR>[0014] Driven by the needs for ever-faster broadband
        transmission, optical\n     fiber technology has improved dramatically and
        now approaches theoretical\n     limits in terms of attenuation and precision
        manufacturing. Taking\n     advantage of such refinements, non-transmission
        applications have now\n     come to the forefront and optical fibers are increasingly
        deployed as\n     sensing elements in numerous industries and applications.\n<BR><BR>[0015]
        In one embodiment, Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) provides near\n     real-time
        measurement utilizing optical fiber by taking advantage of its\n     low attenuation
        and long reach in addition to its dielectric nature and\n     immunity to
        radio frequency and electromagnetic interference. DAS\n     converts the optical
        fiber into a lengthy sensor element (up to 50 km)\n     and detects events
        with very high resolution over the entire distance.\n     With a spatial resolution
        of 1 meter, for example, there will be 10,000\n     synchronized sensors along
        a 10,000 meter fiber.\n<BR><BR>[0016] Acoustic sensing works by coupling coherent
        laser energy pulses\n     into optical fiber and analyzing naturally occurring
        Rayleigh\n     backscatter. See e.g. FIG. 1. Light pulses, as they travel
        from the input\n     to distal end, interact at a molecular level with the
        materials that\n     comprise the core of the fiber. Such interactions cause
        a small amount of\n     light to backscatter and return to the input end where
        they are detected\n     and analyzed. Acoustic waves, when interacting with
        the materials that\n     comprise the optical fiber, create small changes
        in the refractive index.\n     These changes affect the backscatter characteristics,
        becoming detectable\n     events. Using time-domain techniques, event location
        is precisely\n     determined, providing fully distributed sensing with resolution
        of 1\n     meter or less.\n<BR><BR>[0017] Due to the ability of the optic
        fiber to operate in harsh\n     environments, the technology can also be used
        in oil well monitoring\n     applications, allowing real-time information
        on the state of the well to\n     be determined. The industry first used downhole
        fiber optic sensing in\n     the 1990's for single-point pressure and temperature
        sensors. Distributed\n     temperature sensing followed. The oil and gas industry
        provides numerous\n     applications where DAS can be implemented, promising
        the lowest cost per\n     sensor point. Examples include pipeline monitoring
        for distributed flow,\n     distributed seismic detection, and leak detection.
        In addition to\n     pipeline monitoring, harsh environment optical fibers
        are commonly used\n     for in-well applications to detect fracturing processes,
        leaks, flow and\n     seismic activity, all in distributed fashion, allowing
        for thousands of\n     discrete sensing points along a single optical fiber.\n<BR><BR>[0018]
        However, to date, DAS sensors have not been use in borehole\n     surveying.\n<BR><BR>[0019]
        In one embodiment the method described herein uses a DAS fiber\n     optic
        cable in a Reference Well to determine relative distance from an\n     Active
        Well that is being actively drilled or otherwise manipulated. The\n     DAS
        fiber may be deployed in the Reference Well in a variety of\n     manners--fixed
        to the casing, fixed to the tubing, deployed as a wireline\n     or in coiled
        tubing.\n<BR><BR>[0020] Drilling noise and any other acoustic emissions generated
        in the\n     Active Well (e.g. perforations, hydraulic fracturing, drilling
        jars,\n     etc.) are recorded using the DAS fiber in the Reference Well.
        For a given\n     acoustic source emission location in the Active Well, a
        unique signal\n     pattern will be generated and recorded by the DAS system
        in the Reference\n     Well. A variety of pattern recognition, signal processing,
        and event\n     location techniques may then be used to determine the range
        between the\n     Active and Reference Well to high precision and this information
        used to\n     guide the path of the Active Well to achieve the desired well\n
        \    configuration.\n<BR><BR>[0021] As used herein, \"DAS\" or \"Distributed
        Acoustic Sensing\" refers to\n     Rayleigh scatter based distributed fiber
        optic sensing, wherein a\n     coherent laser pulse is sent along an optic
        fiber, and scattering sites\n     within the fiber cause the fiber to act
        as a distributed interferometer\n     with a gauge length approximately equal
        to the pulse length. The\n     intensity of the reflected light is measured
        as a function of time after\n     transmission of the laser pulse. When the
        pulse has had time to travel\n     the full length of the fiber and back,
        the next laser pulse can be sent\n     along the fiber. Changes in the reflected
        intensity of successive pulses\n     from the same region of fiber are caused
        by changes in the optical path\n     length of that section of fiber. This
        type of system is very sensitive to\n     both strain and temperature variations
        of the fiber and measurements can\n     be made simultaneously at all sections
        of the fiber.\n<BR><BR>[0022] Before the next laser pulse can be transmitted
        the previous one\n     must have had time to travel to the far end of the
        fiber and for the\n     reflections from there to return, otherwise reflections
        would be\n     returning from different sections of the fiber at the same
        time and the\n     system would not operate properly. For a fiber 50 km long
        the maximum\n     pulse rate is just over 2 kHz. Therefore strains can be
        measured which\n     vary at frequencies up to the Nyquist frequency of 1
        kHz. Shorter fibers\n     clearly enable higher acquisition rates.\n<BR><BR>[0023]
        As used herein, the \"Reference Well\" is the well equipped with a\n     DAS
        cable that is operatively coupled to a C-OTDR or equivalent\n     equipment.
        In some embodiments more than one Reference Well may be used,\n     e.g.,
        in triangulation applications.\n<BR><BR>[0024] As used herein, the \"Active
        Well\" is that provides the acoustic\n     signals for sensing by the Reference
        Well. Also, a \"test\" well.\n<BR><BR>[0025] The invention includes any one

        light. Such signals can be processed in a\n     manner analogous to processing
        seismic signals, using sophisticated\n     programs and computationally fast
        machines.\n<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE\n<BR><BR>[0073]
        The disclosure provides a novel method of well ranging using DAS\n     sensors.
        DAS transforms nearly any fiber-optic cable into a distributed\n     array
        of acoustic sensors. To record data requires a specialized Coherent\n     Optical
        Time Domain Reflectometer (C-OTDR) unit referred to as an\n     \"Interrogator
        Unit\" or \"IU\", which is connected to the fiber used for\n     measurement.\n<BR><BR>[0074]
        Currently, an entire (.about.4 km) cable can be sampled at a rate\n     of
        up to 20 kHz. At this rate, the IU injects laser pulses into the\n     fiber,
        and as the fiber is strained by external acoustic disturbances,\n     the
        IU processes and records the changes in the back-scattered light.\n     Processing
        divides the fiber into a distributed array of acoustic\n     sensors, which
        results in data that is comparable to conventional seismic\n     data recorded
        on geophones.\n<BR><BR>[0075] An optical pulse is launched into the fiber
        and minute portions of\n     the light traveling outward are (Rayleigh) scattered
        backwards in a\n     distributed manner such that this scattered light returning
        may be\n     measured temporally with a fast receiver to produce a record
        or trace of\n     distributed loss of the fiber out to distances of 10's of
        Km.\n<BR><BR>[0076] If the optical pulses are made with a narrow line width,
        high\n     coherence laser, then these scattered return light signals will
        interfere\n     with each other causing signal ripples that superimpose the
        loss trace.\n     This is shown in FIG. 2. These ripples, because they are
        related to the\n     fixed Rayleigh scatter sites within a fiber, are static
        as long as the\n     fiber is static. If the fiber experiences any perturbations,
        or external\n     forces, which strain the fiber, the positions of the scatter
        sites\n     change. This in turn changes the interferometric induced ripples.\n<BR><BR>[0077]
        Dynamic sensitivities down to the few angstrom levels are\n     achievable.
        The result is a highly sensitive distributed sensing\n     mechanism, known
        as Coherent Optical Time Domain Reflectometry (COTDR),\n     and more recently
        known as Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS).\n<BR><BR>[0078] Because light
        in an optical fiber travels at approximately 0.2\n     m/ns, a 10-ns pulse
        of light occupies about 2 m in the fiber as it\n     propagates. The potential
        of DAS is that each 10 nanoseconds of time in\n     the optical echo response
        can be associated with reflections coming from\n     a 1-m portion of the
        fiber (two-way time of 10 ns). By generating a\n     repeated pulse every
        100 .mu.s and continuously processing the returned\n     optical signal, one
        can, in principle, interrogate each meter of up to 10\n     km of fiber at
        a 10-kHz sample rate. Local changes in the optical\n     backscatter because
        of changes in the environment of the fiber can thus\n     become the basis
        for using the fiber as a continuous array of sensors\n     with nearly continuous
        sampling in both space and time.\n<BR><BR>[0079] Preferably, the system digitally
        records both the amplitude,\n     frequency and phase of the acoustic fields
        up to tens of kilohertz at\n     every location along and, hence, can \"listen\"
        to every point along the\n     fiber. The system can offer 1 meter spatial
        resolution with a wide\n     dynamic range of more than 90 dB and with no
        cross-talk. The fiber thus\n     acts as an acoustic antenna and can be deployed
        in multi-dimensional\n     configurations to enhance its sensitivity, directionality
        and frequency\n     response.\n<BR><BR>[0080] Silixa (Hertfordshire UK), for
        example sells the iDas.TM. system\n     with a new optoelectronics architecture
        that collects the true acoustic\n     signal--amplitude, frequency and phase--to
        accurately and rapidly measure\n     backscattered signal with a precision
        and speed that allows acoustic\n     measurements. In addition, all sensing
        points are phase-matched,\n     therefore the acoustic response along the
        fiber can be combined to\n     enhance the detection sensitivity by two-orders
        of magnitude, which would\n     enable to step beyond the performance of current
        point sensors and as\n     well as achieving highly directional information.\n<BR><BR>[0081]
        One of the challenges is processing a large volume of the data\n     collected
        at high speeds. For 10 km of fiber, 1 m intervals at 10 kHz\n     sampling,
        the minimum data rate is 100 MSamples/s. A number of fast\n     signal processing
        techniques have been developed to analyze the acoustic\n     spectrum of the
        signal along the entire length of fiber and identify flow\n     characteristics
        along the wellbore. In addition using coherent phase\n     array processing
        techniques, the propagation of the acoustic energy along\n     the wellbore
        can be analyzed in space-frequency domain (k-.omega.) to\n     determine the
        speed of sound and, thereby, measure the fluid composition\n     and velocity.\n<BR><BR>[0082]
        DAS systems currently use single-mode fiber, as opposed to the\n     multimode
        fiber typically used for DTS, but the type of fiber does not\n     affect
        deployment, and multiple fibers are easily deployed in a single\n     capillary
        tube.\n<BR><BR>[0083] A DAS fiber optic cable is deployed in the Reference
        Well to\n     determine relative distance and direction from Active Well,
        which is\n     e.g., being actively drilled. Neither dedicated installation
        of fiber nor\n     any optimization of the cable construction or connectors
        is needed, and\n     we used wireline to deploy the DAS cable, although other
        methods can be\n     used.\n<BR><BR>[0084] Unlike the fiber cables used in
        the communication industry, fiber\n     optics designed for oil and gas wells
        utilize specialized glass\n     chemistry, coatings and construction to withstand
        downhole conditions.\n     DAS fiber optic cable suitable for use herein is
        available from a number\n     of suppliers, including OFS (Norcross Ga.);
        Halliburton (Houston Tex.),\n     Schlumberger (Houston Tex.); BMP Enterprises
        (Belleville Tex.) and the\n     like.\n<BR><BR>[0085] The DAS cable is connected
        at the surface to a C-OTDR, which\n     receives, records and processes the
        signals. OTDR instruments are\n     available from many manufacturers, including
        Anritsu America (Richardson\n     Tex.), PiMON (Munich Germany); AFL Global
        (Duncan S.C.). Further, most of\n     the companies selling the DAS fiber
        optic cable for downhole use also\n     sell the OTDR units and have dedicated
        software thereon for the signal\n     analysis algorithms unique to this industry.\n<BR><BR>[0086]
        Drilling noise and any other acoustic emissions generated in the\n     Active
        Well (e.g. drilling, perforations, hydraulic fracturing, etc.) are\n     recorded
        and processed by the OTDR using the DAS fiber in the Reference\n     Well
        and based on that information, the drilling of the Active Well can\n     be
        steered toward the Reference Well if intersection is desired, or\n     steered
        to be parallel thereto, for example in SAGD wellpairs, or\n     otherwise
        steered for the well configuration that is needed.\n<BR><BR>[0087] For a given
        acoustic source emission location in the Active Well, a\n     unique signal
        pattern will be generated and recorded by the DAS system in\n     the Reference
        Well. A variety of pattern recognition, signal processing,\n     and event
        location techniques may then be used to determine the range\n     between
        the Reference and Active wells to high precision.\n<BR><BR>[0088] To date,
        we have tested the above concept using ______ and found\n     that the system
        is accurate up to ______ inches. Recordings were made\n     while tools were
        run in hole, during drilling, perfing and fracking and\n     the technology
        proved sufficiently reliable and sensitive to detect these\n     in-well activities
        and use that information to determine distance and\n     direction from the
        reference well hosting the DAS cable.\n<BR><BR>[0089] The present invention
        is exemplified with respect to an Active Well\n     that was drilled for test
        purposes. However, this is exemplary only, and\n     the invention can be
        broadly applied to control any desired well\n     configuration. The following
        examples are intended to be illustrative\n     only, and not unduly limit
        the scope of the appended claims.\n<BR><BR>Test 1\n<BR><BR>[0090] For the
        testing of the system described herein, we will deploy DAS\n     cable into
        a Reference Well using wirelines. 2000 meters of cable is\n     deployed into
        a local well, and signals recorded using a C-OTDR. An\n     Active well is
        initiated 50 m from the original Reference wellpad, with a\n     pathway intended
        to intersect the Reference well. Signals received by the\n     DAS cable in
        the reference well are interpreted. Our preliminary results\n     are expected
        to show complete accuracy, such that the wells intersect as\n     planned.\n<BR><BR>[0091]
        Using OTDR technology, it is possible to determine an amount of\n     backscattered
        light arriving from any point along the fiber optic cable.\n     Although
        the duration of the light pulse determines the lower limit on\n     the spatial
        resolution, the resulting signal can be used to extract\n     information
        at any larger interval. This can be accomplished by dividing\n     the backscattered
        light signal into a series of bins in time. The data\n     within each bin
        is summed to give information about the average strain on\n     the length
        of fiber between the endpoints of the bin. These bins can be\n     made arbitrarily
        large to sample longer sections of the fiber.\n<BR><BR>[0092] The bins may
        be equally sized and continuously spread over the\n     entire length of the
        fiber with the end of one bin becoming the start of\n     the next, but if
        desired, the size and position of each bin, in addition\n     to the spacing
        between consecutive bins, can be tailored to yield the\n     optimum desired
        spatial sampling resolution and sensitivity.   [0093]\n     Thus, by time-gating
        the received backscattered signal, each fiber optic\n     cable can be treated
        as a plurality of discrete, distributed acoustic\n     \"sensors\" (DAS),
        with each sensor corresponding to a section of cable.\n     The time-gating
        can be controlled to produce sections/sensors that are as\n     long or as
        short as desired. For example, one portion of the cable can\n     sense at
        high resolution, using relatively short sections of cable having\n     lengths
        L-.sub.1, while another portion of cable can sense at a lower\n     resolution,
        using relatively long sections of cable having lengths\n     L.sub.2. In some
        embodiments, higher-resolution section length L.sub.1\n     preferably falls
        within the range 0.1 to 10 m and lower-resolution\n     section length L.sub.2
        preferably falls within the range 10 to 1000+ m.\n     [0094] One of the challenges
        is processing a large volume of the data\n     collected at high speeds. For
        10 km of fiber, 1 m intervals at 10 kHz\n     sampling, the minimum data rate
        is 100 MSamples/s. A number of fast\n     signal processing techniques have
        been developed to analyze the acoustic\n     spectrum of the signal along
        the entire length of fiber and identify flow\n     characteristics along the
        wellbore. In addition using coherent phase\n     array processing techniques,
        the propagation of the acoustic energy along\n     the wellbore can be analyzed
        in space-frequency domain (k-.omega.) to\n     determine the speed of sound
        and, thereby, measure distance, etc.\n<BR><BR>[0095] One example of a suitable
        DAS technology is a system called Blue\n     Rose. This system exploits the
        physical phenomenon of Rayleigh optical\n     scattering, which occurs naturally
        in optical fibers used traditionally\n     for OTDR techniques. Blue Rose
        detects backscattered light and uses the\n     signal to give information
        about acoustic events caused by activities\n     near the cable. The sensor
        is a single strand of single-mode optical\n     fiber with an elastomeric,
        polymeric, metallic, ceramic, or composite\n     coating that is buried in
        the ground at a depth of approximately nine\n     inches. Alternatively, coherent
        OTDR (C-OTDR) processes can be used to\n     obtain similar acoustic information
        from an optical system, as disclosed\n     in US Application No. 20090114386.
        \  [0096] In other embodiments, an\n     optical system such as that described
        in U.S. application Ser. No.\n     2008277568 can be used. That system uses
        pulsed pairs of light signals\n     that have different frequencies and are
        separated in time. If used, such\n     a system allows processing of the signal
        to be carried out more easily\n     and with a greater signal-to noise ratio
        than is the case if radiation of\n     a single frequency backscattered from
        different positions along the\n     length of optical fiber is used to generate
        a signal at a photodetector\n     by interferometery.\n<BR><BR>[0097] The
        present disclosure also relates to a computing apparatus for\n     performing
        the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially\n     constructed for
        the required purposes of signal processing, or it may\n     comprise a general-purpose
        computer selectively activated or reconfigured\n     for signal processing.
        Such computer programs may be stored in a computer\n     readable storage
        medium, preferably non-transitory, such as, but is not\n     limited to, any
        type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks,\n     CD-ROMs, and magnetic-optical
        disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random\n     access memories (RAMs), EPROMs,
        EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, or\n     any type of media suitable for
        storing electronic instructions, each\n     coupled to a computer system bus.\n<BR><BR>[0098]
        In one embodiment, the computer system or apparatus may include\n     graphical
        user interface (GUI) components such as a graphics display and\n     a keyboard
        which can include a pointing device (e.g., a mouse, trackball,\n     or the
        like, not shown) to enable interactive operation. The GUI\n     components
        may be used both to display data and processed data and to\n     allow the
        user to select among options for implementing aspects of the\n     method
        or for adding information about reservoir inputs or parameters to\n     the
        computer programs. The computer system may store the results of the\n     system
        and methods described above on disk storage, for later use and\n     further
        interpretation and analysis. Additionally, the computer system\n     may include
        on or more processors for running said spreadsheet and\n     simulation programs.\n<BR><BR>[0099]
        As yet another option, the computer program can provide a display\n     of
        the two wells, their existing placement as well as the planned\n     trajectory.
        Using this display, the drilling operator can control the\n     trajectory
        to compensate for any unplanned deviations.\n<BR><BR>[0100] Hardware for implementing
        the inventive methods may include\n     massively parallel and distributed
        Linux clusters, which utilize both CPU\n     and GPU architectures. Alternatively,
        the hardware may use a LINUX OS,\n     XML universal interface run with supercomputing
        facilities provided by\n     Linux Networx, including the next-generation
        Clusterworx Advanced cluster\n     management system. Another system is the
        Microsoft Windows 7 Enterprise\n     or Ultimate Edition (64-bit, SP1) with
        Dual quad-core or hex-core\n     processor, 64 GB RAM memory with Fast rotational
        speed hard disk\n     (10,000-15,000 rpm) or solid state drive (300 GB) with
        NVIDIA Quadro\n     K5000 graphics card and high resolution monitor. Slower
        systems could\n     also be used.\n<BR><BR>[0101] The term \"many-core\" as
        used herein denotes a computer\n     architectural design whose cores include
        CPUs and GPUs. Generally, the\n     term \"cores\" has been applied to measure
        how many CPUs are on a giving\n     computer chip. However, graphic cores
        are now being used to offset the\n     work of CPUs. Essentially, many-core
        processors use both computer and\n     graphic processing units as cores.\n<BR><BR>[0102]
