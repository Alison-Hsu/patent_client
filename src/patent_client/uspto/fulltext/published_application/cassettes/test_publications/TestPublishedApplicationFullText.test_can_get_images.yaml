        \  <P>\n A Double Blinded Privacy-Safe Distributed Data Mining Protocol is\n
        \    disclosed, among an aggregator, a data consumer entity having\n     privacy-sensitive
        information, and data source entities having\n     privacy-sensitive information.
        The aggregator does not have access to the\n     privacy-sensitive information
        at either the data consumer entity or the\n     data source entities. The
        aggregator formulates a query without using\n     privacy-sensitive information,
        and sends the query to the data consumer\n     entity. The data consumer entity
        generates a list of specific instances\n     that meet the conditions of the
        query and sends the list, encrypted, to\n     the data source entities either
        directly or through the aggregator. The\n     data source entities match the
        list against transactional data,\n     de-identify the matched results, and
        send them to the aggregator. The\n     aggregator combines results from data
        source entities and sends the\n     combined result to the data consumer entity.
        This allows for privacy-safe\n     data mining where both the data consumer
        entity and data source entities\n     have privacy-sensitive information not
        available for the aggregator to\n     see or use.\n</P>\n   <HR>\n<TABLE WIDTH=\"100%\">\n<TR>

        all\n     copyright rights whatsoever.\n       <BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR>[0003]
        The present invention generally relates to data privacy and data\n     usage
        in distributed database systems--often belonging to disparate\n     owners.
        More specifically, the present invention relates to coordination\n     of
        data privileges while simultaneously preserving data privacy and\n     allowing
        useful facilitation of privacy sensitive data features.\n<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
        OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR>[0004] The worlds of database coordination, data
        rights and data usage are\n     inherently paradoxical, since privacy preserving
        legal rights restrict\n     usage of technical functions in some circumstances
        while permitting these\n     same technical functions in other circumstances.
        Simply stated, usage of\n     functions such as sort, search, merge, and Boolean
        logical operators are\n     the pith and marrow of database operations--except
        when one of the\n     database fields or a combination of several fields may
        lead to\n     identification of a person.\n<BR><BR>[0005] Identifiable data
        may not be from one field and may not be that\n     explicit. For example,
        a study done on the Census data in the US\n     demonstrated that 87% of US
        population can be uniquely identified just\n     based on Date-Of-Birth, Sex
        and ZIP code. There is also the issue of\n     being able to re-identify someone
        based on an external public database\n     (such as voter registration that
        includes DOB, Sex and ZIP). So bottom\n     line, the real issue is the level
        uniqueness of a record and not\n     necessarily a specific field. It is with
        this very concern in mind that\n     data providers bundle their information
        goods into identity camouflaged\n     collections or otherwise aggregate records
        or \"trim\" down the data to\n     create more \"same\" records (e.g. report
        only the first three digits of a\n     ZIP code or report only year of birth)--so
        that one cannot know, at a\n     certain level of probability, if some particular
        John Doe is present in\n     one category of an eventual statistical report
        or any specific details\n     about him; even though this report is based
        on information goods where\n     John Doe is explicitly labeled, quantitatively
        described and\n     categorically characterized.\n<BR><BR>[0006] Numerous
        fields of endeavor come to mind wherein this data privacy\n     paradox prohibits
        making best use of the information--especially for\n     applications that
        are not concerned with any particular John Doe. For\n     example, healthcare
        organizations such as physician practices, labs,\n     hospitals and health
        maintenance organizations (HMOs) keep extensive\n     medical records including
        data on each specific patient and on each\n     specific doctor. The Health
        Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\n     of 1996 (HIPAA) in the
        USA and similar legislation in other jurisdictions\n     prevents HMOs and
        healthcare providers from sharing data at full\n     transparency--since the
        privacy of individuals must be preserved. (see\n     FIGS. 1 & 2 for further
        details) Nevertheless, without any interest in\n     specific individuals,
        pharmaceutical companies could greatly improve many\n     technical and mercantile
        aspects of their operation--if they were given\n     unrestricted access to
        the HMO raw data. Similar data opacity exists\n     between banks and insurance
        companies, between sellers of goods and\n     credit card companies, between
        the census bureau and other government\n     agencies (e.g. tax authorities,
        public health systems, etc.).\n<BR><BR>[0007] Just for example, the HIPAA
        related section talking about\n     de-identification says: .sctn. 164.514
        Other requirements relating to\n     uses and disclosures of protected health
        information.\n<BR><BR>[0008] (a) Standard: de-identification of protected
        health information.\n     Health information that does not identify an individual
        and with respect\n     to which there is no reasonable basis to believe that
        the information can\n     be used to identify an individual is not individually
        identifiable health\n     information.\n<BR><BR>[0009] (b) Implementation
        specifications: requirements for\n     de-identification of protected health
        information. A covered entity may\n     determine that health information
        is not individually identifiable health\n     information only if:\n<BR><BR>[0010]
        (1) A person with appropriate knowledge of and experience with\n     generally
        accepted statistical and scientific principles and methods for\n     rendering
        information not individually identifiable: (i) Applying such\n     principles
        and methods, determines that the risk is very small that the\n     information
        could be used, alone or in combination with other reasonably\n     available
        information, by an anticipated recipient to identify an\n     individual who
        is a subject of the information; and (ii) Documents the\n     methods and
        results of the analysis that justify such determination; or\n<BR><BR>[0011]
        (2)(i) The following identifiers of the individual or of relatives,\n     employers,
        or household members of the individual, are removed: (A)\n     Names; (B)
        All geographic subdivisions smaller than a State, including\n     street address,
        city, county, precinct, zip code, and their equivalent\n     geo-codes, except
        for the initial three digits of a zip code if,\n     according to the current
        publicly available data from the Bureau of the\n     Census: (1) The geographic
        unit formed by combining all zip codes with\n     the same three initial digits
        contains more than 20,000 people; and (2)\n     The initial three digits of
        a zip code for all such geographic units\n     containing 20,000 or fewer

        dates directly related to an individual,\n     including birth date, admission
        date, discharge date, date of death; and\n     all ages over 89 and all elements
        of dates (including year) indicative of\n     such age, except that such ages
        and elements may be aggregated into a\n     single category of age 90 or older;
        (D) Telephone numbers; (E) Fax\n     numbers; (F) Electronic mail addresses;
        (G) Social security numbers; (H)\n     Medical record numbers; (I) Health
        plan beneficiary numbers; (J) Account\n     numbers; (K) Certificate/license
        numbers; (L) Vehicle identifiers and\n     serial numbers, including license
        plate numbers; (M) Device identifiers\n     and serial numbers; (N) Web Universal
        Resource Locators (URLs); (O)\n     Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers;
        (P) Biometric identifiers,\n     including finger and voice prints; (Q) Full
        face photographic images and\n     any comparable images; and (R) Any other
        unique identifying number,\n     characteristic, or code; and (ii) The covered
        entity does not have actual\n     knowledge that the information could be
        used alone or in combination with\n     other information to identify an individual
        who is a subject of the\n     information.\n<BR><BR>[0012] Again, specifically
        with reference to a non-limiting example of\n     health care related information
        systems--it is worthy to note some\n     additional Background Factors:\n<BR><BR>[0013]
        (A) The rising cost of health care--Health care expenses and\n     utilization
        are growing at an alarming, unprecedented rate. In 2000\n     Americans spent
        $1.3 trillion on health care. That's more than was spent\n     on food, housing,
        automobiles or national defense. And by 2010, health\n     care expenditures
        are expected to double to $2.6 trillion--15.9 percent\n     of our Gross Domestic
        Product, according to the Centers for Medicare and\n     Medicaid Services.
        There are many reasons to the significant increase in\n     cost. While addressing
        this challenge is a hot political, social and\n     ethical issue, there is
        an agreement that healthcare information can be\n     used to guide toward
        a more effective and efficient use of healthcare\n     resources.\n<BR><BR>[0014]
        (B) The role of data in healthcare--analyses of adequate healthcare\n     data
        can be used for a wide range of application including: identifying\n     ways
        to improve the effectiveness, safety and efficiency of health care\n     delivery;
        retrospective population studies to understand risk factors and\n     therapeutic
        option; public health and epidemiological studies; the\n     understanding
        of healthcare errors and compliance issues and the\n     understanding of
        the effectiveness of healthcare innovations\n     communication to healthcare
        professionals and consumers (healthcare\n     marketing). Many of these applications
        contribute to a better and more\n     efficient healthcare system.\n<BR><BR>[0015]
        (C) Health transaction data sources--healthcare claims data,\n     transaction
        data and medical data is being created, stored and\n     communicated by various
        healthcare organizations. Healthcare providers\n     frequently initiate large
        amounts of data as they diagnose, perform\n     various clinical tests, perform
        medical procedures, and prescribe\n     treatment. Elements of the clinical
        information also exist with the\n     laboratories, pharmacies, HMOs and other
        healthcare payers, as well as a\n     range of other service organizations
        such as clearinghouses and PBMs.\n     Health transaction data is protected
        by privacy standards such as the\n     HIPAA in the USA. In many different
        areas of the healthcare system data\n     is being used for both internal
        applications within the organization that\n     generated the data or for
        external applications, by properly\n     de-identifying transaction data from
        patient identifiers.\n<BR><BR>[0016] (D) Aggregated de-identified data, physician
        level--In the\n     pharmaceutical industry data is commonly used to direct
        pharmaceutical\n     companies promotional efforts. Pharmacy datasets are
        typically aggregated\n     to the physician (or prescriber) level and include
        share and volume data\n     (Total Rx and New Rx or TRx and NRx). In generating
        this datasets, the\n     original identifiable and complete data is de-identified
        and aggregated\n     and therefore a \"lower resolution\" of data is available
        as an output, or\n     in other words a portion of the original dataset is
        lost and no longer\n     available for analyses.\n<BR><BR>[0017] (E) Longitudinal
        patient-level data--A second-generation level of\n     data is now also available
        for pharmaceutical applications. Frequently\n     called anonymous (or de-identified)
        patient-level data, these datasets\n     link several records of the same
        person over time, therefore providing\n     better understanding of both consumers
        and physicians. These datasets\n     never include identifiable patient information
        and sometimes also lack\n     physician identifiers. In generating these datasets,
        the original\n     identifiable and complete data is de-identified and aggregated
        and\n     therefore a \"lower resolution\" of data is available as an output,
        or in\n     other words a portion of the original dataset is lost and no longer\n
        \    available for analyses. In addition, at times methods such as one-way\n
        \    hash encryptions are used to be able to identify the same entity over\n
        \    time and across datasets. The use of constant one-way hash to link or\n
        \    match records for the same person or entity may have substantial\n     drawbacks
        in terms of risk of downstream re-identification (e.g. access\n     to the
        one-way hash and a set of personal information may allow\n     generation
        of an individual's encrypted identifier and therefore\n     re-identification)
        as well as significantly reduced matching and/or\n     linking capability.\n<BR><BR>[0018]
        (F) Direct-to-consumer, DTC as a trend--Specifically the\n     pharmaceutical
        industry (and sometimes the medical device manufacturers),\n     communicate
        directly with consumers to drive awareness to various medical\n     conditions
        and to specific products. Direct-to-Consumer marketing has\n     grown significantly
        since the FDA has relaxed its regulation on such\n     activities in 1997.
        DTC initiatives range from advertising initiatives to\n     initiatives that
        are very well targeted through a one-to-one dialog. Some\n     initiatives
        are specifically aimed at users of a particular medication to\n     encourage
        them to use the product correctly, or as prescribed, and for\n     chronic
        conditions, encourage users to use the medication for a long\n     period
        of time (persistency). DTC promotional activities are examples of\n     Health
        Programs as defined herein.\n<BR><BR>[0019] (G) Adherence to therapies (compliance)
        as a major health\n     issue--many healthcare stakeholders appreciate the
        need to enhance\n     compliance to medical treatments prescribed by doctors.
        The World Health\n     Organization published a study under the name \"Adherence
        to Long-Term\n     Therapies: Evidence for Action\". As part of the introduction
        to the study\n     the WHO wrote--Adherence to therapies is a primary determinant
        of\n     treatment success. Poor adherence attenuates optimum clinical benefits\n
        \    and therefore reduces the overall effectiveness of health systems.\n
        \    \"Medicines will not work if you do not take them\"--Medicines will not
        be\n     effective if patients do not follow prescribed treatment, yet in\n
        \    developed countries only 50% of patients who suffer from chronic diseases\n
        \    adhere to treatment recommendations. Improving compliance is one are
        that\n     substantial more progress is needed with benefits to all healthcare\n
        \    stakeholders. Various sophisticated Health Programs, as defined herein,\n
        \    are launched by various sponsors with the goal of improving compliance.\n<BR><BR>[0020]
        (H) Nature of health programs and data collected; type of\n     intervention
        and possible combinations--There are many different types of\n     health
        programs and likewise different entities who may be interested in\n     sponsoring
        and delivering these programs. Goals can vary based on\n     sponsors (government,
        HMOs, employers, pharmaceutical companies, etc.).\n     Health programs can
        have the goals of raising product awareness,\n     acquiring new customers,
        encouraging patient compliance with medication\n     regimen, expanding the
        overall diagnosed market, improve healthcare\n     outcomes, improve quality
        of life, reduce overall cost to the healthcare\n     system, etc. Other non-pharmaceutical
        manufacturer sponsored health\n     programs may include public health efforts
        or disease/care management as\n     well as other health promotion programs
        promoted by healthcare\n     associations, payers and others.\n<BR><BR>[0021]
        (I) In-sufficiency of target consumer program measurement while\n     data
        exist because of privacy issues--The challenge of measuring the\n     impact
        of a consumer health program becomes significant whenever the\n     health
        program sponsor does not have the full healthcare information of\n     the
        target population at their disposal. Blocked by both access to data\n     as
        well as privacy challenges, sponsoring organizations have to assess\n     the
        impact of their efforts with very limited methods. As described above\n     in
        this section, HIPAA provides substantial limitation on Personal Health\n     Information
        and existing de-identification method may render the\n     information useless
        for the purpose of measuring the impact of health\n     programs. Naturally,
        with limited measurement abilities, less resources\n     are directed by sponsors
        to valuable health programs such as compliance\n     programs.\n<BR><BR>[0022]
        (J) \"Soft\" measurement of health programs, activity or\n     self-reported
        measurement--As a result of the above mentioned\n     limitations, existing
        methods for assessing health programs and marketing\n     programs that effect
        a subset of the consumer/patient population include\n     self reported data
        such as patient surveys or activity measurement such\n     as the number of
        messages sent to the consumer, etc. Other approaches\n     include: (i) consumer
        panels where consumers are surveyed on some regular\n     basis. (ii) regionally
        or otherwise focused initiatives can be measured\n     by a regional analysis
        if (iii) other fairly complex and limited methods\n     to infer patient behavior.\n<BR><BR>[0023]
        Now, in these and countless other (non-health system related)\n     examples,
        many useful advances to understanding would occur if the data\n     privacy
        restrictions were lifted--since records could be aligned\n     according to
        name and/or ID--thereby presenting to researchers a portrait\n     of reality
        at substantially higher resolution. However, if this merger\n     were allowed,
        then countless opportunities to breach personal privacy\n     would occur
        in violations of laws and regulations--eventually causing\n     many individuals
        to stop providing accurate information to their HMOs and\n     healthcare
        providers, the census bureau, and/or to stop using their\n     credit card,
        etc. Accordingly, there is a long felt need in the art for a\n     protocol
        that will allow higher resolution query and manipulation of\n     privacy
        sensitive data while simultaneously allowing individual privacy\n     to be
        preserved. Furthermore, it is reasonable to consider that any\n     progress
        in the direction of better data utilization while maintaining\n     privacy
        would constitute progress.\n<BR><BR>Key Definitions:\n<BR><BR>[0024] Data
        Source Entity--organizations that generate, capture or store\n     (for example--in
        the health care industry) medical and claims data that\n     includes identifiable
        personal health information. That includes\n     physician office, hospitals,
        labs and other healthcare providers;\n     pharmacies; and HMOs, MCOs, self-insured
        employers, insurance companies,\n     PBMs and other such entities. It also
        includes claims clearinghouses and\n     any other \"Covered Entities\" as
        defined under HIPAA. Conceptually, the\n     source-entity also includes other
        entities operating as a vendor for the\n     source-entity under a privacy
        agreement (such as HIPAA Business Associate\n     Agreement). Furthermore,
        there are non-health care data source\n     entities--such as credit card
        companies, credit bureaus, insurance\n     companies, banks, the census bureau,
        social service agencies, law\n     enforcement agencies, and the likes, all
        of which share common\n     functionality as collectors and maintainers of
        myriads of data including\n     therein personal identifiable data.\n<BR><BR>[0025]
        Data Consumer Entity--organizations that would like to get\n     analytics
        services to answer marketing, operational, quality, (for\n     example) health
        outcome or other business related question regarding a\n     specific (for
        example) health program, initiative, a subset or all of the\n     marketplace,
        etc. Data Consumer Entities are interested in strategic and\n     tactical
        analyses to help them optimize their resource investment to\n     achieve
        their objectives. Examples can be the government, researchers,\n     product
        and service (for example) healthcare companies, etc. Specifically\n     in
        healthcare, detailed population information can have a remarkable role\n     in
        the identification of public health trends, retrospective health\n     outcomes,
        clinical research and development, medical errors and other\n     valuable
        healthcare applications.\n<BR><BR>[0026] Data Originator Entity--organizations
        that generate, capture or\n     store personal identifiable data (\"originating
        information\"), from which\n     can be generated a list of instances that
        satisfy a condition or\n     conditions in a query. The query is related,
        of course, to the question\n     that the Data Consumer Entity wants answered.
        Data Originator Entities\n     can include health care organizations like
        physician offices, hospitals,\n     labs and other healthcare providers, pharmacies,
        HMOs, MCOs, self-insured\n     employers, insurance companies, PBMs, claims
        clearinghouses, and other\n     such entities. Data Originator Entities can
        also include other entities\n     operating as a vendor for the Data Source
        Entity under a privacy\n     agreement. There are also non-health care Data
        Originator Entities, such\n     as credit card companies, credit bureaus,
        MSOs, cable TV companies,\n     insurance companies, banks, the census bureau,
        social service agencies,\n     law enforcement agencies, and the like, all
        of which share common\n     functionality as collectors and maintainers of
        data including therein\n     personal identifiable data. The Data Originator
        Entity can be the same as\n     the Data Consumer Entity (i.e., where the
        Data Consumer Entity has access\n     to suitable originating information),
        or the two entities can be\n     different (i.e., where the Data Consumer
        Entity does not have access to\n     suitable originating information).\n<BR><BR>[0027]
        One example of a non-health care Data Originator Entity is a cable\n     TV
        company with detailed records of household cable-box channel settings,\n     household
        billing information and advertising schedules. The cable\n     company information
        reveals what TV show or other entertainment content a\n     particular household
        was watching at a particular time, and through this\n     information it can
        be deduced which advertisements that particular\n     household was exposed
        to. Such originating information is suitable for\n     handling queries such
        as, but not limited to, \"all households who had the\n     opportunity to
        see commercial advertising X between date A and date B\".\n     The objective
        of such a query is to link advertisement exposure to\n     transactional purchasing
        information, in order to answer the question of\n     a Data Consumer Entity
        (which might be a health care company, a consumer\n     products company,
        etc.), concerning how many households that saw a\n     particular advertisement
        subsequently purchased the advertised product or\n     service.\n<BR><BR>[0028]

        any of its embodiments--and derivative uses thereof (see FIGS. 4 & 5\n     for
        preferred embodiment details)\n<BR><BR>[0029] Health Program--a program (used
        as specific example for the\n     preferred embodiment of the instant invention)
        that affects a subset of\n     the overall potential population. Typically
        patients, consumers or\n     healthcare professionals will opt-in to participate
        in such a program and\n     if the organization sponsoring it is not covered
        by HIPAA, the sponsoring\n     organization will adhere to its published privacy
        policy. Typically\n     Health Programs capture personal identifying information.
        Health Programs\n     may include for example compliance programs or may include
        a broadcast\n     advertising component (such as TV commercials) encouraging
        consumers to\n     call a toll-free number or go to a web-site for further
        information.\n     Frequently, at the call center or web-site, some consumer
        information is\n     captured.\n<BR><BR>[0030] Typical Identifiable Data Captured
        in a Health Program--Some\n     combination of the following fields or similar
        to those: First Name; Last\n     Name; Date of Birth Or Year of Birth; Zip
        Code; Full Address; Phone\n     Number(s); Fax Number(s); E-Mail; Prescribing
        Doctor Name, Address or\n     Other Identifiers; Medical Condition or Drug
        Prescribed; Gender; Social\n     Security. NOTE: Variability of data discussion--personal
        data frequently\n     changes. (See discussion on this in U.S. Pat. No. 6,397,224
        and Math,\n     Myth & Magic of Name Search & Matching by SearchSoftwareAmerica)
        A subset\n     of this data jointly can serve as an identifier with high probability
        of\n     uniqueness. For example, Date of Birth and phone number could serve\n
        \    jointly as unique identifiers. Data Source Entity information structure\n
        \    (of typical health care related identifiers) may include all or some
        of\n     the above plus a unique member ID. (Note: See U.S. Pat. No. 5,544,044;\n

        multiple different\n     \"source-entities\" each of which preserves its privacy
        restrictions, yet\n     under certain conditions the data can be aggregated
        by the aggregator\n     processor to provide a more comprehensive analysis.\n<BR><BR>[0032]
        A number of different embodiments are described below, most of\n     which
        involve the aggregator processor having access to the information\n     at
        the data consumer entity or entities. However, another embodiment is\n     also
        described below, wherein the aggregator processor does not have full\n     access
        to the information at either the data consumer entity/entities or\n     the
        data source entity/entities--because the information at both the data\n     consumer
        entity/entities (and/or the data originator entity/entities) and\n     the
        data source entity/entities are privacy-sensitive and may not be\n     shared
        with the aggregator processor. Yet, in this latter embodiment the\n     aggregator
        processor does have access to the matched and de-identified\n     results
        of the query, so that the aggregator processor can analyze those\n     results
        and deliver the final analysis result to the data consumer\n     entity/entities.
        This latter embodiment, which can be thought of as a\n     \"double-blinded\"
        embodiment because the aggregator processor is blind to\n     both the privacy-sensitive
        information at the data consumer\n     entity/entities (and/or the data originator
        entity/entities) and the\n     privacy-sensitive information at the data source
        entity/entities, has\n     advantages in situations where the information
        at the data consumer\n     entity/entities (and/or the data originator entity/entities)
        is\n     sensitive, and not even the aggregator should have exposure to it.\n<BR><BR>[0033]
        Economic Issues: Preferred embodiments of the instant invention\n     allow
        exploitation of an order of magnitude more value potential from the\n     data
        currently resident at the \"source-entity\" processors while only\n     adding
        nominal expenses at the \"aggregator\" processor. Furthermore,\n     expenses
        at the \"aggregator\" processor are essential to define and\n     provide
        new avenues of access to the ensemble of privacy sensitive data\n     located
        at the \"source-entity\" processors.\n<BR><BR>[0034] Technical Issues: Preferred
        embodiments of the instant invention\n     essentially are composed of software
        packages that each respectively sit\n     in different data processing machines
        where they interact with database\n     packages on that respective machine
        or a machine connected to it via a\n     network. The software packages are
        interconnected with each other using\n     standard data-communications facilities
        (e.g. Internet, VPN, etc.).\n     Accordingly, from a technical perspective,
        embodiments of the instant\n     invention are convolutions of quasi-familiar
        software modules--allowing\n     implementation to be straightforward in today's
        data complexity\n     environment.\n<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR>[0035]
        The aforesaid longstanding needs are significantly addressed by\n     embodiments
        of the present invention, which specifically relates to The\n     Privacy
        Preserving Data-Mining Protocol. The instant protocol is\n     especially
        useful in society-computer interactions wherein there exist\n     actual needs
        or economic benefits from allowing higher resolution query\n     and manipulation
        of privacy sensitive data while simultaneously not\n     allowing individual
        privacy to be breached.\n<BR><BR>[0036] Embodiments of the instant invention
        relate to a Privacy Preserving\n     Data-Mining Protocol, (see FIG. 3) operating
        between a secure\n     \"aggregator\" data processor 300 and at least one
        secure \"source-entity\"\n     data processors 350, wherein the \"aggregator\"
        and the \"source-entity\"\n     processors are interconnected via an electronic
        data-communications\n     topology 399, and the protocol includes the steps
        of:\n<BR><BR>[0037] (A) on the side of the \"aggregator\" processor:\n<BR><BR>[0038]
        (i) from a user interface--accepting 315 a query against a\n     plurality
        of the predetermined attributes and therewith forming a\n     parameter list,\n<BR><BR>[0039]
        (ii) via the topology--transmitting 320 the parameter list to each\n     of
        the \"source-entity\" processors,\n<BR><BR>[0040] (iii) via the topology--receiving
        325 a respective file from each\n     of the \"source-entity\" processors,\n<BR><BR>[0041]
        (iv) aggregating 330 the plurality of files into a data-warehouse,\n<BR><BR>[0042]
        (v) using the parameter list, extracting 335 query relevant data\n     from
        the data-warehouse,\n<BR><BR>[0043] (vi) agglomerating 340 the extract, and\n<BR><BR>[0044]
        (vii) to a user interface--reporting 345 the agglomerated extract;\n     and\n<BR><BR>[0045]
        (B) on the side of each processor of the at least one\n     \"source-entity\"
        processors:\n<BR><BR>[0046] (i) accumulating 355 data-items wherein some of
        the data-items have\n     privacy sensitive micro-data,\n<BR><BR>[0047] (ii)
        organizing 360 the data-items using the plurality of\n     predetermined attributes,\n<BR><BR>[0048]
        (iii) via the topology--receiving 365 a parameter list from the\n     \"aggregator\"
        processor,\n<BR><BR>[0049] (iv) forming 370 a file by \"crunching together\"
        the data-items\n     according to the parameter list,\n<BR><BR>[0050] (v)
        filtering out 375 portions of the file which characterize\n     details particular
        to less than a predetermined quantity of\n     micro-data-specific data-items,
        and\n<BR><BR>[0051] (vii) via the topology--transmitting 380 the file to the\n
        \    \"aggregator\" processor.\n<BR><BR>[0052] After turning to FIGS. 4, 4A
        (a conceptually more detailed version\n     of FIG. 4), and 5, let's examine
        each of the sub-steps and explain what\n     it accomplishes and how collectively
        it results in accomplishing an\n     improvement over the aforesaid long felt
        need.\n<BR><BR>[0053] Embodiments of the Privacy Preserving Data-Mining Protocol
        are\n     operating between a secure \"aggregator\" data processor--which
        is a\n     central data processing machine--and at least one secure \"source-entity\"\n
        \    data processors--which are other data processing machines that\n     respectively
        include records having privacy identified data such as name,\n     identity
        number, or the likes. Until the present invention, it was the\n     practice
        of the \"source-entity\" machines to query these records for\n     internal
        use using the privacy identified fields--such as looking as an\n     individual
        person's records as a single unit, etc. However, it is\n     generally legally
        prohibited for the \"source-entity\" to share and/or sell\n     data having
        the privacy sensitive fields or fields that would allow\n     correlation
        with other data whereby the privacy sensitive identifier\n     could be \"guessed\".
        Therefore, it has become common practice for\n     \"source-entity\" data
        gatherers to condense their data around larger\n     cluster variables--such
        as by age group or by state or by gender. While\n     this practice preserves
        the privacy of individuals by dissolving their\n     identity into an ensemble
        of others, it simultaneously precludes external\n     researchers from benefiting
        from the richness of the \"source-entity\"\n     data.\n<BR><BR>[0054] Now,
        the \"aggregator\" and the \"source-entity\" processors are\n     interconnected
        via an electronic data-communications topology--such as\n     the Internet,
        or a virtual private circuit or the likes; all of which\n     eliminates any
        need for the processors to be collectively centralized.\n     Rather, the
        processors may remain distributed, as is the case in today's\n     world.
        To summarize up to here, the protocol operates using\n     data-communications
        facilities to interconnect a central aggregator\n     processor with at least
        one source-entity processors. The source entity\n     processors each have
        respective privacy sensitive data content along with\n     other data content
        aspects.\n<BR><BR>[0055] Now, according to the instant protocol, on the side
        of the\n     \"aggregator\" processor (A) there are seven sub-steps. First,
        a sub-step\n     of \"(A-i) from a user interface--accepting a query against
        a plurality of\n     the predetermined attributes and therewith forming a
        parameter list\" that\n     establishes the aggregator as the focus of a query
        that may include\n     problematic privacy-sensitive information that the
        source-entity cannot\n     release to an \"outsider\". Intrinsically, in the
        context of the instant\n     invention, the parameters of the list may include
        identity disclosing\n     specifics--which probably do not pass ordinary criteria
        of even nominal\n     privacy thresholds, and/or broader variables--which
        probably do pass\n     ordinary criteria of normal, rigid, or strict privacy
        thresholds.\n<BR><BR>[0056] These identity-disclosing specifics may be such
        things as name,\n     personal identity number or simple data combinations
        that would allow\n     breach of privacy if applies to disclose identity.
        What is important in\n     the further application of the instant method is
        that these\n     identity-disclosing specifics are part of a large enough
        list in the\n     processing of a query so that the query result will present
        sufficient\n     statistical distribution to protect the \"reverse engineering\"
        of the\n     result back to any individual in the initial query list. For
        example, the\n     instant method can ask about the status of Tom, Dick, Harry,
        and a\n     further collection of individuals--and obtain results from that
        query--so\n     long as the statistical character of those results will not
        allow\n     correlation of a result specific back to an individual. Thus it
        may be\n     that the query includes a list of 10,000 personal IDs and the
        results\n     show that these individuals belong to group A with 60% probability,
        Group\n     B with 25% probability, and one of Groups C-E with the remaining
        15%\n     probability. Accordingly, transmitting the parameter list may include\n
        \    transmitting a sufficiently large list of identity disclosing specifics.\n<BR><BR>[0057]
        Simply stated, the aggregator may accept a query that includes lots\n     of
        identity specifics (e.g. a list of names or a combination of a few\n     fields
        that together can allow identification)--the type of query that\n     one
        does not expect to be answerable in any privacy preserving fashion.\n     This
        sub-step essentially converts a model base postulate about the data\n     (that
        relationships that the user wonders) into a formal language query\n     phrases
        according to shared variable definitions mutually accepted by the\n     aggregator
        and the source-entities. The parameter list would include a\n     definition
        of the population to be analyzed such as by geography, age or\n     other
        attributes. One of the most novel features of the instant protocol\n     is
        that the parameter list may even include specific individuals by name\n     or
        ID or the likes. It will simply be necessary that the number of the\n     individuals
        in any population definition be large enough to dilute any\n     definitive
        conclusion about an individual's personal data into the \"sea\"\n     of the
        group (of names') data. According to some specific instant\n     embodiments,
        all or part of the parameter list is encrypted.\n<BR><BR>[0058] Next, the
        sub-step of \"(A-ii) via the topology--transmitting the\n     parameter list
        to each of the \"source-entity\" processors\" sends the\n     formalized query--in
        whatever format is mutual agreed to by the\n     aggregator with each respective
        source-entity. It may occur that the\n     aggregator phrases the formal query
        differently to some source-entities\n     than to other source-entities--and
        this is probably the most pragmatic\n     embodiment. Sometime thereafter
        is the sub-step of \"(A-iii) via the\n     topology--receiving a respective
        file from each of the \"source-entity\"\n     processors\" whereby the aggregator
        receives some answer (or a null\n     answer) from each source-entity; however
        (as we will understand from the\n     source-entity side of the instant protocol)
        while the question included\n     parameters which request that the source-entity
        correlate data according\n     to privacy sensitive data aspects, the answer
        is condensed into an\n     identity free representation.\n<BR><BR>[0059] For
        example, in the testing of an unusual postulate, the query asks\n     to characterize
        patients who have a specific health problem and who\n     receive a specific
        therapy in terms of the seniority of their attending\n     physicians. In
        order to answer the query, the source entity must compare\n     records with
        same patient names & IDs to name & ID specific physician\n     records. However,
        the answer is a table of seniority brackets of\n     physicians compared to
        a data cluster of multiple patients' data.\n     According to this type of
        example, a pharmaceutical company user could\n     find out from a plurality
        of HMOs source-entity records if the company\n     should market its therapy
        primarily to senior physicians or primarily to\n     junior physicians, or
        both. Simply stated, the query test one possible\n     postulate about the
        humanity of physicians--and that query has\n     interesting economic implications
        for pharmaceutical companies.\n<BR><BR>[0060] Next, the sub-step \"(A-iv)
        aggregating the plurality of files into\n     a data-warehouse\" goes further
        to protect privacy by bundling the\n     responses of the individual source-entities
        into a large source-entity\n     de-identified data collection and at the
        same time deliver results from\n     multiple distributed and different data-sources.
        Thus, the sub-step\n     \"(A-v) using the parameter list, extracting query
        relevant data from the\n     data-warehouse\" allows for getting all the relevant
        data of the data\n     warehouse to a single temporary collections including
        responses from one\n     or more source-entity query-response cycles and other
        data which may come\n     from the ordinary reporting of source-entities or
        others. Now, in\n     sub-step \"(A-vi) agglomerating the extract\", a condensed
        picture of all\n     of the data which may uphold or reject the postulates
        of the query are\n     summarized together; and finally in sub-step \"(A-vii)
        to a user\n     interface--reporting the agglomerated extract\".\n<BR><BR>[0061]
        Furthermore, (B) on the side of each processor of the at least one\n     \"source-entity\"
        processors, the first two sub-steps call for ordinary\n     operations--such
        as \"(B-i) accumulating data-items wherein some of the\n     data-items have
        privacy sensitive micro-data, and (B-ii) organizing the\n     data-items using
        the plurality of predetermined attributes\". Thereafter,\n     the sub-steps
        (B-iii) via the topology--receiving a parameter list from\n     the \"aggregator\"
        processor\" let the source-entity begin to participate in\n     the user initiated
        \"project\" that is being managed by the aggregator.\n<BR><BR>[0062] From
        here, the next sub-step \"(B-iv) forming a file by \"crunching\n     together\"
        the data-items according to the parameter list\" causes each\n     respective
        source-entity to perform the necessary internal data base\n     queries and
        to perform the necessary correlations and formation of\n     temporary data-interrelationships
        in order to know the local answer to\n     all or part of the initial user
        query that was sent through the\n     aggregator. If the parameter list included
        specific individuals by name\n     or ID or the likes, \"Crunching together\"
        may involve name matching\n     through \"fuzzy logic\" and other name matching
        algorithms of the\n     population defined by the parameter list with the
        source-entity database\n     names, in addition to the other steps defined
        above. Having done that,\n     the sub-step \"(B-v) filtering out portions
        of the file which characterize\n     details particular to less than a predetermined
        quantity of\n     micro-data-specific data-items\" eliminates portions of
        the answer which\n     might allow the user to guess the identity some data
        attribute--because\n     that data attribute belongs to an individual or to
        a very small group of\n     members. This step is necessary--since it eliminates
        one degree of trust\n     from the relationship between the source-entity
        and the aggregator. In\n     all good conscience, the source-entity has preserved
        his duty to protect\n     the identity of individuals in his data collection.
        Simply stated, in the\n     context of the instant invention, filtering is
        synonymous for\n     implementing a privacy threshold at the \"source-entity\"
        level. In the\n     HIPAA example, a certification by a statistician would
        set the allowed\n     fields and required numerical levels to consider the
        results\n     \"de-identified\". Finally, to complete the protocol, there
        remains the\n     sub-step of (B-vi) via the topology--transmitting the file
        to the\n     \"aggregator\" processor\" is accomplished according to well-known
        methods\n     in the art.\n<BR><BR>[0063] Reviewing the relationships between
        the user, the aggregator, and\n     the source-entities, one notices that
        the user is permitted to phrase\n     queries that may cause a source-entity
        to perform database functions\n     requiring identity specific data--but
        this does not cause the identity,\n     per se, to be revealed outside of
        the source-entity jurisdiction.\n     Secondly, the aggregator may now collect
        and assemble identity protected\n     reports from numerous data collections
        (source-entities) and assemble\n     them into a single report--thereby potentially
        greatly increasing the\n     statistical significance of conclusions that
        can be drawn from the\n     aggregator report to the user. Furthermore, the
        very revealing aspect\n     that all or most of the result may be coming from
        a single source-entity\n     is protected. For example, it might be very politically
        sensitive to\n     realize that attitudes of physicians in one HMO radically
        differ from\n     physicians in all other HMOs--and this peculiarity may be
        hidden from the\n     user by using an aggregator.\n<BR><BR>[0064] According
        to a first preferred embodiment of the instant invention,\n     agglomerating
        the extract includes filtering out portions of the extract\n     which characterize
        details particular to less than a predetermined\n     quantity data-items.
        According to the preferred variation of this\n     embodiment filtering out
        portions of the extract which characterize\n     details particular to less
        than a predetermined quantity data-items\n     includes the predetermined
        quantity being selected from the list, ordinal\n     number, percentage of
        instances in the data-warehouse, data instances\n     outside of mean plus
        predetermined number of standard distribution units.\n<BR><BR>[0065] According
        to a second preferred embodiment of the instant\n     invention, agglomerating
        the extract includes filtering out portions of\n     the extract so that only
        identity-free micro-data or identity-free\n     aggregated data remains.\n<BR><BR>[0066]
        According to a third preferred embodiment of the instant invention,\n     accepting
        a query includes performing a preprocessing privacy check\n     against a
        predetermined source-entity data-ensemble model.\n<BR><BR>[0067] According
        to a fourth preferred embodiment of the instant\n     invention, \"crunching
        together\" the data-items includes joining\n     data-items having a mutual
        or similar micro-data-specific (for example\n     similar names with variations
        such as nick name, prefix, suffix, etc.).\n<BR><BR>[0068] According to a fifth
        preferred embodiment of the instant invention,\n     selected from the list
        of sub-steps aggregating, extracting,\n     agglomerating, accumulating, organizing,
        and crunching, at least one\n     sub-step includes fuzzy matching.\n<BR><BR>[0069]
        According to a sixth preferred embodiment of the instant invention,\n     (on
        the source-entity processor side) filtering out portions of the file\n     which
        characterize details particular to less than a predetermined\n     quantity
        of micro-data-specific data-items includes selecting the\n     predetermined
        quantity from the list, an ordinal number, a percentage of\n     instances
        in the data-warehouse, data instances outside of statistical\n     mean-or-median
        plus-and/or-minus a predetermined number of standard\n     deviation units.\n<BR><BR>[0070]
        According to a seventh preferred embodiment of the instant\n     invention,
        accepting a query includes transforming the query into a\n     standardized
        query--capable of resulting in a syndicated reporting of the\n     agglomerated
        extract. In this context, it is preferred that, a Markup\n     Language be
        used which directly links aspects of the query with aspects\n     of the reporting--since
        it is anticipated that various industries will\n     adopt the instant protocol
        to produce substantially real-time\n     \"testimonies\".\n<BR><BR>[0071]
        Some collateral embodiments of the instant invention relate to (see\n     FIG.
        6) a program storage device 600 readable by machine, tangibly\n     embodying

        agglomerating 670 the\n     extract, and (vii) to a user interface--reporting
        680 the agglomerated\n     extract.\n<BR><BR>[0072] Other collateral embodiments
        of the instant invention relate to\n     (see FIG. 7) a program storage device
        700 readable by machine, tangibly\n     embodying a program of instructions
        executable by the machine to perform\n     method steps for secure \"source-entity\"
        data processor functions in a\n     Privacy Preserving Data-Mining Protocol,
        said method steps including: (i)\n     accumulating 710 data-items wherein
        some of the data-items have privacy\n     sensitive micro-data, (ii) organizing
        720 the data-items using the\n     plurality of predetermined attributes,
        (iii) via an electronic\n     data-communications topology--receiving 730
        a parameter list from an\n     \"aggregator\" processor, (iv) forming 740
        a file by \"crunching together\"\n     the data-items according to the parameter

        details particular to less than a\n     predetermined quantity of micro-data-specific
        data-items, and (vi) via\n     the topology--transmitting 760 the file to
        the \"aggregator\" processor.\n<BR><BR>[0073] Notwithstanding the aforesaid,
        general embodiments of the instant\n     invention (see FIG. 8) relate to
        a Privacy Preserving Data-Mining\n     Protocol 800, substantially as herein
        before described and illustrated,\n     firstly characterized by having at
        least one of mutually independent\n     secure \"source-entity\" data processors
        810 respectively forming 820 a\n     file by \"crunching together\" data-items
        according to a parameter list,\n     and thereafter respectively filtering
        830 out portions of the file which\n     characterize details particular to
        less than a predetermined quantity of\n     micro-data-specific data-items;
        and secondly characterized by having a\n     secure \"aggregator\" data processor
        850 aggregating 860 the plurality of\n     files into a data-warehouse. Furthermore,
        other variation embodiments of\n     the instant protocol are bi-directional--meaning
        that the fundamental\n     relationship between the \"source-entity\" and
        \"aggregator\" processors is\n     reversed and/or reversible!\n<BR><BR>[0074]
        Thus, it is accurate to summarize that the fundamental embodiments\n     of
        the Privacy Preserving Data-Mining Protocol of the instant invention\n     operate
        between a secure \"aggregator\" data processor and at least one\n     secure
        \"source-entity\" data processors. The \"aggregator\" and the\n     \"source-entity\"
        processors are interconnected via an electronic\n     data-communications
        topology. The protocol is characterized by including\n     the data-communications
        coordinated steps of: the at least one mutually\n     independent secure \"source-entity\"
        data processors respectively forming a\n     file by \"crunching together\"
        data-items according to a parameter list,\n     and thereafter respectively
        filtering out portions of the file which\n     characterize details particular
        to less than a predetermined quantity of\n     micro-data-specific data-items;
        and the secure \"aggregator\" data\n     processor aggregating the plurality
        of files into a data-warehouse.\n<BR><BR>[0075] Embodiments of the protocol
        of the instant invention are applicable\n     to many arms-length data rights
        relationships, including (for example)\n     those that exist between healthcare
        providers, pharmacies, PBMs or Health\n     Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)
        & Pharmaceutical-Companies; electronic\n     commerce & market research; banking
        & insurance; census bureau & other\n     government agencies; auditors & independent
        procurement/service\n     organizations; and the likes.\n<BR><BR>[0076] A
        further class of embodiments of the Privacy Preserving\n     Data-Mining Protocol
        of the present invention is worthy of note; and\n     these are interim data
        merger enabled embodiments. Simply stated, these\n     embodiments allow for
        the linkage of data items as related to a common\n     entity. For example,
        an individual was a regular member of a first health\n     care medical expense
        insurance plan and then switched to become a member\n     of a second health
        care medical expense insurance plan. If the data\n     sources are careful
        to encrypt the identifying portions of each record\n     using a common encryption
        \"key\", then further down the data processing\n     circuit it will be possible
        to link records related to a common\n     individual without compromising
        the identity of that individual. Of\n     course, special care must be taken
        that the entity performing the linkage\n     is not capable of knowing the
        key and decryption function; because\n     knowing these facets would enable
        a breach of the individual's privacy.\n     (Note: U.S. Pat. No. 6,397,224
        considered some aspects of using third\n     party key holding to respect
        individual privacy--albeit without\n     facilitating anonymous linkages between
        a plurality of data records.)\n<BR><BR>[0077] Returning now to FIGS. 3 and
        8 (and Mutatis Mutandis to their\n     respective program storage devices),
        it can now be appreciated that there\n     are numerous locations where an
        encryption of individual identification\n     and/or merger of data for individuals
        could be facilitated. By way of\n     non-limiting example, on the \"aggregator\"
        processor side, the encryption\n     and/or merger could be enable during
        the sub-steps: receiving a\n     respective file, or aggregating the plurality
        of files; or on the\n     \"source-entity\" processors' side, the encryption
        and/or merger could be\n     enabled during the sub-steps: organizing the
        data-items, forming a file,\n     or filtering out portions of the file.\n<BR><BR>[0078]
        Thus there are at least two different situations where data from\n     the
        data source is returned already aggregated, after analysis as well as\n     a
        second option where data is release at the micro-level (each person's\n     data),
        but the person identity information, for the matched population,\n     is
        replaced with a unique encryption key, such as a one way hash or\n     Advanced
        Encryption Standard (AES) or the likes. This compatible\n     encryption for
        the identifying micro-level data preserves the ability to\n     know that
        the two records belong to the same identity, but preserve the\n     privacy
        of the identity of that person. Each situation has viable\n     options, albeit
        with respectively different advantages and disadvantages.\n<BR><BR>[0079]
        According to the preferred variation of this interim data merger\n     enabled
        class of embodiments, the ability to link micro-level records\n     related
        to the same identity at the data aggregator level is\n     preserved--even
        if the records came from two different data sources.\n<BR><BR>[0080] Recall,
        at substantially each data source there is performed a name\n     matching
        to identify all of the records for a certain identity (e.g. for\n     Jane
        Doe). In that identity matching, the result may be several\n     combinations
        of personal identifiers for the same person--for example\n     (Jane Doe,
        (Boston, Mass.), health-plan ID 1234) and (Jane Doe, (New\n     York, N.Y.)
        health-plan ID 5678) may both appear in a single data source.\n     Since
        the name matching preferably has \"fuzzy logic\", the software in the\n     data
        source will find both. When releasing data from the data source to\n     the
        data aggregator, the personal IDs will be encrypted--but using the\n     same
        key in all data sources--a key that will preferably not be known to\n     the
        Crossix protocol operator, but only a trusted third party such as an\n     escrow
        agent. Now assume that a second data source also had data for\n     (Jane
        Doe, (New York, N.Y.) health-plan ID 5678).\n<BR><BR>[0081] Now, at the data
        aggregator, data will be received from each data\n     source, and the desire
        is to know that one instantiation with variation\n     of Jane Doe is the
        same as another for a second data source. The way to\n     achieve that is
        to encrypt more than a single ID for each person--so in\n     the data released
        from the first data source--we will get both keys and\n     the healthcare
        data (WXYZ (key1), ABCD (key2), other de-identified\n     healthcare data)
        and from the second data source we will get (WXYZ, other\n     de-identified
        healthcare data). Because of the fact that we encrypt\n     several key that
        can uniquely identify the person, we can link their\n     healthcare record
        for a more complete analysis. For example, if a person\n     filled a prescription
        in one pharmacy, took a job with another employer\n     (and therefore received
        a new health plan ID) but still used the same\n     pharmacy, and eventually
        moved to another city; then, using the current\n     merger embodiment, one
        could analyze whether that person is compliant and\n     persistent in refilling
        the prescription for his medication (an important\n     healthcare datum for
        that person)--even though the identity of that\n     person is not knowable
        to the analyzer.\n<BR><BR>[0082] Thus, it should be apparent to the ordinary
        man of the art that the\n     afore-mentioned interim data merger enabled
        embodiments and the likes are\n     essentially elaborations of various imbedded
        encryption strategies for\n     micro-data and their respective potential
        advantages--all in the context\n     of the instant Privacy Preserving Data-Mining
        Protocol.\n<BR><BR>Notices\n<BR><BR>[0083] The present invention is herein
        described with a certain degree of\n     particularity, however those versed
        in the art will readily appreciate\n     that various modifications and alterations
        may be carried out without\n     departing from either the spirit or scope,
        as hereinafter claimed.\n<BR><BR>[0084] For example, every step requiring
        a transmitting of data (or of at\n     least one file) and every respective
        associated step requiring receiving\n     of that data (or of that at least
        one file) may preferably include\n     respective encryption and decryption--however
        the nature and quality of\n     this security aspect is well understood by
        the systems administrator; in\n     the context of his specific regulatory
        environment, etc. Nevertheless, it\n     is generally preferable to include
        some degree of data transmission\n     security. (Compliant with this rationale,
        process occurring in processors\n     of running the instant protocol should
        be secure--and certified as such.)\n<BR><BR>[0085] Another example relates
        to applications of the instant protocol, in\n     that it is anticipated that
        countless examples of privacy preservation\n     may be achieved between heretofore
        strictly separated entities (\"a query\n     relationship\")--such as pharmaceutical
        companies and HMOs (Health\n     Maintenance Organizations), market researchers
        and credit card companies,\n     government agencies and the census bureau,
        Law Enforcement Agencies\n     seeking to understand general aspects of a
        social problem (as recorded in\n     countless private data-banks) without
        needing a search warrant for any\n     specific individual or class or individuals,
        and similar heretofore\n     detail-opaque query and answer data opportunities.
        Thus, it is\n     anticipated that at least one of an at least two electronic
        data\n     providers is selected from the list: data source entity, data consumer\n
        \    entity, health program, pharmaceutical manufacturer/distributor, public\n
        \    health regulator/monitor; credit card bureau, market research\n     organization,
        banking consortium, census bureau, government agency, or\n     the likes.\n<BR><BR>[0086]
        A further example, relates to the inclusion of at least a\n     predetermined
        minimum number of individuals (identified by name or ID,\n     address, phone
        number, date of birth, e-mail or the likes or a\n     combination thereof)
        into a \"parameter list\" (that is formed or\n     transmitted in the instant
        protocol)--and these individuals may be\n     persons or legal entities or
        individual motor vehicles or individual\n     computers or serial numbering
        industrial products or legal registration\n     numbers or license numbers
        or the likes. Returning to the above-mentioned\n     aspects of preferable
        encryption, it is certainly strongly advised that\n     regardless of the
        general level of encryption elected, a parameter list\n     including \"individuals\"
        should carry a stronger level of encryption.\n     Nevertheless, in each \"query
        relationship\" there are different legal\n     standards which may be applicable--such
        as in health care in the USA,\n     interim between-party results must be
        HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability\n     and Accountability Act of 1996)
        de-identified without micro-data specific\n     content or substantially equivalently
        provably statistically intractable.\n<BR><BR>[0087] Thus, in describing the
        present invention, explanations are\n     presented in light of currently
        accepted Data-Processing theories and\n     Legal-Privacy models. Such theories
        and models are subject to\n     quantitative (computational) & qualitative
        (cultural) changes, both\n     adiabatic and radical. Often these changes
        occur because representations\n     for fundamental component elements are
        innovated, because new\n     transformations between these elements are conceived,
        or because new\n     interpretations arise for these elements or for their
        transformations.\n     Therefore, it is important to note that the present
        invention relates to\n     specific technological actualization in embodiments.
        Accordingly, theory\n     or model dependent explanations herein, related
        to these embodiments, are\n     presented for the purpose of teaching, the
        current man of the art or the\n     current team of the art, how these embodiments
        may be substantially\n     realized in practice. Alternative or equivalent
        explanations for these\n     embodiments may neither deny nor alter their
        realization.\n<BR><BR>[0088] A further embodiment of the present invention
        is shown in FIGS. 9\n     and 10. In this embodiment, the aggregator processor
        does not have access\n     to the information at either the data consumer
        entity/entities (and/or\n     the data originator entity/entities) or the
        data source entity/entities.\n     This embodiment can be thought of as \"double-blinded\"
        because the\n     aggregator processor is blind to both the privacy-sensitive
        information\n     at the data consumer entity/entities (and/or the data originator\n
        \    entity/entities) and the privacy-sensitive information at the data source\n
        \    entity/entities. Yet, the aggregator processor does have access to the\n
        \    matched and de-identified results of the query, so that the aggregator\n
        \    processor can analyze those results and deliver the final analysis result\n
        \    to the data consumer entity/entities. In contrast, the other embodiments\n
        \    can be thought of as \"single-blinded\" because the aggregator processor
        is\n     blind to the privacy-sensitive information at the data source\n     entity/entities,
        although the aggregator does have access to the\n     information at the data
        consumer entity/entities (and/or the data\n     originator entity/entities)
        despite its privacy-sensitive nature.\n<BR><BR>[0089] The double-blinded embodiment
        is used in situations where the\n     information at the data consumer entity/entities
        (and/or the data\n     originator entity/entities) is sensitive, and not even
        the aggregator\n     should have exposure to it. A good example of such a
        situation is where\n     the data consumer entity is a cable TV company that
        has detailed records\n     (possibly second-by-second) of household cable-box
        channel settings,\n     household billing information and advertising schedules
        (i.e., which ads\n     were broadcasted on what channel at what time). In
        other words, the cable\n     company information reveals what TV show or other
        entertainment content a\n     particular household was watching at a particular
        time, and through this\n     information it can be deduced which advertisements
        that particular\n     household was exposed to. The cable company's information
        is privacy\n     sensitive and can not be released to the aggregator as is,
        because it\n     contains the family name, their address, or other identifying
        indicia\n     along with information about the family's viewing habits that
        the family\n     may not wish to be known. Indeed, the cable TV company may
        also wish the\n     viewing habits of specific families to remain private,
        in order to avoid\n     the negative publicity should it become known that
        the cable TV company\n     did not keep such information private.\n<BR><BR>[0090]
        Other examples of data consumer entities that potentially have\n     privacy-sensitive
        information which cannot be revealed to the aggregator\n     include credit
        card companies, airline companies, auto rental companies,\n     publisher
        and online media companies as well as healthcare companies such\n     as pharmacies,
        hospitals and managed care organizations. When a\n     healthcare company
        is the data consumer entity, the need to keep its\n     information private
        from even the aggregator is particularly acute, since\n     various laws and
        regulations including HIPAA may require complete\n     privacy.\n<BR><BR>[0091]
        Another reason the information at the data consumer entity could be\n     privacy-sensitive
        is that it may not even be the data consumer entity's\n     own information.
        Instead, the information may be acquired by the data\n     consumer entity
        from a third party who requires that the information be\n     kept private.
        Or, this \"originating information\" may not be available to\n     the data
        consumer entity at all, and may instead be provided by a data\n     originator
        entity who is a third party unconnected with the data consumer\n     entity.
        This latter situation is shown in FIGS. 11 and 12, and is\n     exemplified
        by the following situation: let's say the data consumer\n     entity is a
        pharmaceutical company that wishes to have a certain business\n     question
        answered. The pharmaceutical company does not have access to\n     originating
        information, and the originating information is instead\n     provided by
        a third party--for example a cable TV company--with suitable\n     information
        that can generate a list of specific instances which meet the\n     conditions
        in the query. In this situation, the data consumer entity is\n     not involved
        in generating the list at the front end of the process.\n     However, the
        data consumer entity of course still receives the analysis\n     results from
        the aggregator at the back end of the process, so that the\n     data consumer
        entity's business question is answered.\n<BR><BR>[0092] It should also be
        understood that the situation discussed above,\n     wherein the data consumer
        entity does not have access to any or all of\n     the originating information,
        and at least some of the originating\n     information is instead provided
        by a third party--a \"data originator\n     entity\"--with suitable information
        that can generate a list of specific\n     instances which meet the conditions
        in the query, can also exist for the\n     single-blinded embodiments described
        herein. Said another way, the\n     situation wherein a separate data originator
        entity (not the data\n     consumer entity) supplies the originating information
        can exist in cases\n     where the originating information can be shared with
        the aggregator, and\n     cases where it cannot.\n       <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION

        THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR>[0100] Note: Solely for the sake of simplicity--in
        order that the ordinary\n     man of the art may appreciate the unique facility
        of the instant\n     protocol, the (non-limiting) example of detail will be
        for the health\n     care industry. One reason for this choice is that compliance
        with HIPAA\n     (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996)
        is a\n     well-known semi-intractable problem that is adequately documented
        for use\n     as an objective metric of the usefulness of the instant invention.
        Thus,\n     the instant example relates to using embodiments of the Protocol
        of the\n     present invention as a computer-implemented method for profiling
        health\n     programs while maintaining participant privacy. (The specific
        background\n     details related to health care information systems are presented
        in the\n     latter part of the background section.)\n<BR><BR>[0101] Simply
        stated, embodiments of the instant profile are\n     computer-implemented
        for profiling health programs--to assist program\n     planners such as marketing
        managers from pharmaceutical manufacturers or\n     other health promotion
        managers to assess the aggregate behavior of a\n     large group of participants
        impacted by a specific health program\n     compared to a control group. The
        assessment of the impact of a particular\n     program is done by profiling
        participants aggregate objective health\n     transaction data (pharmacy,
        treatment, diagnosis, lab, etc.) to conclude\n     various effects of the
        health program compared with a possibly defined\n     control group while
        adhering to current and evolving privacy standards\n     and laws such as
        HIPAA.\n<BR><BR>[0102] Objective health transaction data resides within healthcare\n
        \    organizations such as health service providers (doctors, hospitals, labs,\n
        \    etc.) and health plans (managed care plans, HMOs, PPOs, insurance\n     companies,
        pharmacy benefit managers, self-insured employers, state and\n     federal
        government health benefit programs, etc.). These organizations\n     are governed
        by a set of privacy standards, rules and regulations such as\n     HIPAA and
        therefore has severe limitation in their use of healthcare\n     information
        that includes identifiable personal health information.\n<BR><BR>[0103] Here
        is an example to use of this instant protocol: (Background:) A\n     pharmaceutical
        company that manufacture a pharmaceutical product for the\n     treatment
        of multiple sclerosis has established several health programs\n     to encourage
        consumers of that product to use the product persistently\n     and correctly.
        Such health programs include a Call Center Program staffed\n     by nurses
        who can answer ongoing questions and train consumers on how to\n     use the
        product correctly and a Web-Site Program that includes health\n     management
        tools and access to relevant disease information. These\n     pharmaceutical
        health programs are promoted to consumers of that product\n     who then opt-in
        to participate in the program. The participants of each\n     program allow,
        among other things, the pharmaceutical manufacturer to\n     analyze their
        data in aggregate. Some of the participants of the\n     manufacturer health
        programs belong to various healthcare organizations\n     that aggregate health
        transactions generated by the consumers in their\n     ongoing consumption
        of healthcare services and products. This health\n     transactions data includes
        diagnosis data, treatment data, pharmacy data\n     and sometimes clinical
        data such as lab data and other health data.\n<BR><BR>[0104] Applying the
        method of the instant protocol include necessary,\n     sufficient, and elective
        operations--according to the \"reality\" of the\n     current non-limiting
        example; and these operations include: Extracting\n     the lists of participants
        in the Call Center Program and the Web-Site\n     Program (names, addresses
        and other possible identifiable information);\n     Providing a definition
        of control group. For example, all consumers who\n     consume the manufacturer
        product but are not participants in either the\n     Call Center Program or
        Web-Site Program; then Providing a definition of\n     analysis required.
        For example, a mathematical definition for persistent\n     usage of the pharmaceutical
        product, or total cost of healthcare\n     consumed, or hospitalization cost,
        etc. Some analyses can be fairly\n     complex and use other processes and
        patented methods such as ETG (e.g.\n     U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,835,897 and 6,370,511B1);
        (Optional) Encrypting the\n     lists using any industry grade encryption
        method; and Delivering the\n     lists of participants together to a query
        engine with a capability to\n     decrypt the lists at the time of processing
        (optional) to one or more\n     healthcare organizations that store health
        transactions. Health plans\n     tend to be mutually exclusive, meaning if
        a member belongs to any plan,\n     that member typically belongs to that
        one plan only or is likely to\n     consume similar service at a similar time
        from only one health plan.\n     Therefore, this algorithm can be used--by
        repeating the same process with\n     multiple health plans; and then simply
        summing the results from all\n     health plans.\n<BR><BR>[0105] For each
        health plan: The query engine runs a \"fuzzy matching\"\n     algorithm to
        match participants in the pharmaceutical health program with\n     the health
        transactions at the healthcare organization; For all the\n     matched users
        the query engine runs the analysis of their health\n     transaction data
        to determine the result of the requested analysis (such\n     as persistency
        of using the pharmaceutical product); The query engine\n     runs the control
        group analysis for all users that were not matched but\n     meet the control
        group definition (for example, users of the\n     pharmaceutical product);
        and Aggregate the results to the following\n     groups: Call Center Program
        participants only; Web-Site Program\n     participants only; participants
        in both the Call Center Program and the\n     Web-Site Program; Control group
        (for example, all consumers of the\n     pharmaceutical product that are neither
        participants of the Call Center\n     Program nor the Web-Site Program).\n<BR><BR>[0106]
        For each group provide the following result: Name of group, %\n     participants
        matched with the healthcare organization health transaction\n     data, and
        statistical result of all matched members (such as average\n     persistency
        rate); The query engine determines whether the number of\n     participants
        in each program and the % participants matched are above a\n     level that
        ensures consumer individual privacy (based on a statistical\n     definition).
        If not, the query engine responds with: group name \"cannot\n     be analyzed
        because of privacy safeguards. Please try to define a bigger\n     group of
        users\"; and the query engine output for each health plan is\n     aggregated
        to provide an overall output that may be shared with the\n     pharmaceutical
        manufacturer.\n<BR><BR>[0107] This instant protocol method offers valuable
        aggregate assessment\n     of health programs based on objective health transaction
        data without\n     disclosing identifiable personal health information. Most
        methods used\n     today are based on \"soft measurements\" of value, such
        as activity-based\n     measurements (people enrolled, number of interactions,
        etc.) and/or\n     self-reported data (participants fill surveys or other
        questionnaire\n     regarding their behavior). Objective measurement based
        on health\n     transaction could become the gold-standard to measure such
        activities.\n<BR><BR>[0108] Most existing analytics services in healthcare
        are based on a model\n     where patient-level health transactions are de-identified
        and then\n     aggregated and processed for analysis. Clearly through this
        process,\n     high-resolution raw data that includes the maximum amount of
        information\n     is reduced to a lower resolution data to preserve privacy
        and possibly\n     other interests. Many companies, including IMS Health,
        SDI (formerly\n     Verispan, a joint venture between Quintiles and McKesson),
        Pharmetrics,\n     Dendrite, Wolters Kluwer Health and others employ this
        model. This\n     existing health analytics model may provide either physician
        level\n     behavior or de-identified patient-level behavior and possibly
        a\n     combination of both. However, while this model is very effective in\n
        \    analyzing longitudinal patient behavior and, in some cases, matching
        it\n     to a known prescriber (such as physician), no linkage can be made
        to a\n     consumer health program that only impact a subset of the market
        (unless\n     the program correlates well with a limited region or cover a
        known group\n     of physicians). One cannot query or analyze parameters that
        are no longer\n     in the lower resolution dataset. Therefore, the existing
        healthcare\n     analytics model does not provide the capability to aggregate
        the behavior\n     of a group of patients by a predefined list of consumers
        participating in\n     a health program. This is only one example of the limitations
        of the\n     existing healthcare analytics model that is addressed by the
        instant\n     protocol.\n<BR><BR>[0109] For the above described application
        of the instant protocol to be\n     properly effective, access is needed to
        a combined health transaction\n     data that is: (A) large enough to provide
        sufficient level of matching to\n     address privacy concerns and to enable
        statistically significant\n     analysis; and (B) to represent an approximation
        to the distribution of\n     the general market as much as possible (regions,
        demographics, type of\n     populations and type of insurances) or allow statistical
        correction based\n     on pre known parameters. For example, if the data source,
        a specific\n     health plan, includes 15M lives well distributed across the
        country and\n     representative in every other aspect except that this particular
        health\n     plan has a formulary that prefers particular pharmaceutical products
        over\n     others, a statistical analysis could be used to \"correct\" that
        preference\n     based on national analysis of formularies.\n<BR><BR>[0110]
        Recalling the health care related information system background\n     factors
        of the background section, substantially, the instant protocol\n     embodiment
        (the Crossix Method) is a method to enable the statistical\n     measurement
        of one or more Health Programs and the compounded effect of\n     combination
        of multiple Health Programs based on analysis of health\n     transaction
        data while complying with Data Source Entity privacy\n     regulations and
        Data Consumer Entity privacy policy.\n<BR><BR>[0111] By contrast, an example
        of \"classic\" model of health analytics\n     calls for aggregation of de-identified
        patient-level or physician-level\n     data which allow the central analysis
        model only (see FIGS. 1 & 2). The\n     common method used by existing healthcare
        analytics companies (such as\n     IMS, Wolters Kluwer Health (formerly NDCHealth)
        and SDI (formerly\n     Verispan) is based on the following steps: (A) De-identify
        &\n     Aggregate--patient data is de-identified (some data is removed or
        grouped\n     together) and data is reported typically at the physician level.
        In some\n     cases the dataset includes longitudinal de-identified patient-level
        data\n     (such as Verispan and Dendrite) (B) Collect from various sources--data
        is\n     collected from multiple healthcare organizations into a data warehouse\n
        \    (C) Analyze--syndicated data reports and custom studies are produced.\n<BR><BR>[0112]
        The instant Crossix \"method\" is based on an opposite sequence: (A)\n     Analyze--the
        healthcare organization (such as health plan) runs an\n     analysis software
        that receive as an input the required analysis and\n     aggregation level
        as well as possibly a list of identifiable patients or\n     physicians for
        which analysis is requested. This analysis is performed on\n     the original,
        most complete data set; (B) De-identify & Aggregate--Once\n     name matching
        and analysis is complete data is aggregated and, if needed,\n     de-identified;
        (C) and Collect from various sources--Analysis responses\n     from multiple
        organization are composed to deliver the analyses\n     requested.\n<BR><BR>[0113]
        Turning now to FIG. 9 and the double-blinded embodiment shown\n     therein,
        an aggregator 900, via a user interface to the inventive system,\n     formulates
        a query without having access to any privacy-sensitive data at\n     one or
        more data consumer entities 910. (For clarity of illustration,\n     data
        consumer entities 910 are shown as one box, rather than showing a\n     separate
        box for each data consumer entity--but it should be understood\n     that
        there can be one data consumer entity or a plurality of them.) In\n     the
        case where data consumer entity 910 is a cable TV company, an example\n     query
        might be \"all households who had the opportunity to see commercial\n     advertising
        X between date A and date B\". The objective of such a query\n     is to link
        TV advertising viewership (i.e., exposure to an advertisement)\n     to transactional
        purchasing information--to see, for example, how many\n     households that
        saw a particular advertisement subsequently purchased the\n     advertised
        product or service.\n<BR><BR>[0114] Aggregator 900 sends the query to one
        or more data consumer\n     entities 910, and the data consumer entities 910
        process the query by\n     accessing their data and generating a list of specific
        instances that\n     meet the conditions in the query. In the example case,
        the list would\n     comprise specific households that saw advertising X between
        date A and\n     date B. Data consumer entities 910 can either encrypt the
        list, using any\n     suitable encryption method including without limitation
        a symmetrical key\n     available to source-entities, public-private encryption
        keys, a one-way\n     hash encryption applied to multiple combination of identifying
        fields\n     supporting matching based on multiple values and other similar\n
        \    combination, or alternatively can choose not to encrypt the list. Data\n
        \    consumer entities 910 then send their encrypted or unencrypted lists\n
        \    directly to one or more data source entities 920 for matching against\n
        \    transactional data, such as purchasing data. (For clarity of\n     illustration,
        data source entities 920 are shown as one box, rather than\n     showing a
        separate box for each data source entity--but it should be\n     understood
        that there can be one data source entity or a plurality of\n     them.) Alternatively,
        data consumer entities 910 can send their encrypted\n     lists through aggregator
        900, in which case aggregator 900 forwards the\n     lists to data source
        entities 920. In this latter case, the information\n     on the lists is kept
        confidential because the aggregator 900 does not\n     have a decryption key
        which will decrypt it.\n<BR><BR>[0115] The matching is done using a matching
        algorithm similar to the one\n     described for the single-blind embodiments,
        without necessarily providing\n     access by data source entities 920 to
        a particular data consumer entity's\n     privacy-sensitive information. In
        other words, the data source entities\n     can perform the matching on encrypted
        data received from data consumer\n     entities 910 (in which case the Date
        Cruncher Module exemplified in FIG.\n     5 employs a decryption key), or
        on unencrypted data received from data\n     consumer entities 910 (in which
        case the Date Cruncher Module exemplified\n     in FIG. 5 does not need to
        employ a decryption key).\n<BR><BR>[0116] After matching, the matched individuals'
        data (the results) are\n     de-identified using methods and systems similar
        to those described\n     earlier for the single-blind embodiments, and sent
        back to aggregator\n     900. Aggregator 900 merges the results from data
        source entities 920 into\n     one combined Final Analysis Result, using methods
        and systems similar to\n     those described earlier for the single-blind
        embodiments, and sends the\n     Final Analysis Result to the one or more
        data consumer entities 910.\n<BR><BR>[0117] FIG. 10 illustrates another double-blinded
        embodiment wherein\n     instead of aggregator 900 generating the query, the
        data consumer entity\n     920 generates the query, and using its privacy-sensitive
        information,\n     develops the list of specific instances (e.g., households)
        that meet the\n     conditions of the query. As described in the FIG. 9 embodiment,
        data\n     consumer entity 920 can encrypt the list in multiple ways before
        sending\n     it directly to data source entities 920, or can send the list
        to data\n     source entities 920 unencrypted. Alternatively, data consumer
        entity 910\n     can send its encrypted list through aggregator 900, in which
        case\n     aggregator 900 forwards the list to data source entities 920. Thus
        in\n     this embodiment, aggregator 900 is not involved in generating the
        query\n     on the front end of the process, but still aggregates the results
        from\n     data source entities 920 into one combined Final Analysis Result
        and\n     provides that result to data consumer entity 910.\n<BR><BR>[0118]
        FIG. 11 illustrates yet another double-blinded embodiment similar\n     to
        FIG. 9, except that a separate data originator entity 930 provides the\n     originating
        information, and thus aggregator 900 sends the query to data\n     originator
        entity 930 and not to data consumer entity 910. Data\n     originator entity
        930 uses its information to generate a list of specific\n     instances that
        meet the conditions in the query, optionally encrypts the\n     list using
        any suitable encryption method including those previously\n     described
        herein, and sends the list to data source entities 920, either\n     directly
        or through aggregator 900. (As in FIG. 9, data originator\n     entities 930
        are shown as one box, rather than showing a separate box for\n     each data
        originator entity.) The other aspects of this embodiment match\n     those
        of the FIG. 9 embodiment--for example, at the end of the process,\n     data
        consumer entity 910 still receives the Final Analysis Result from\n     aggregator
        900.\n<BR><BR>[0119] FIG. 12 illustrates yet another double-blinded embodiment
        similar\n     to FIG. 10, except that a separate data originator entity 930
        provides\n     the originating information, instead of data consumer entity
        910. Data\n     originator entity 930 also formulates the query, uses its
        information to\n     generate a list of specific instances that meet the conditions
        in the\n     query, optionally encrypts the list, and sends the list to data
        source\n     entities 920, either directly or through aggregator 900. (As
        in FIG. 10,\n     data originator entities 930 are shown as one box, rather
        than showing a\n     separate box for each data originator entity.) The other
        aspects of this\n     embodiment match those of the FIG. 10 embodiment--for
        example, at the end\n     of the process, data consumer entity 910 still receives
        the Final\n     Analysis Result from aggregator 900.\n<BR><BR>[0120] Final
        Notices Firstly, it should be appreciated that embodiments of\n     the instant
        invention relate to the protocol as a whole, individually to\n     respective
        aspects operating on an \"aggregator\" processor and on a\n     \"source-entity\"
        processor; to specific configurations of computer\n     readable software
        for allowing either processor to execute characterizing\n     steps of the
        protocol, and to memory media having any of said software\n     encoded therein;
        wherein the memory media includes physical media--such\n     as magnetic or
        optical disks, read only memory and the likes, and to\n     virtual media--such
        as downloadable execution code data transmission and\n     the likes. Finally,
        while the invention has been described with respect\n     to specific examples
        including presently preferred modes of carrying out\n     the invention, those
        skilled in the art will appreciate that there are\n     numerous variations
        and permutations of the above described systems and\n     techniques that
