        \    <HR>\n       <BR><BR>FIELD\n<BR><BR>[0001] The invention generally relates
        to processes for the polymerization\n     of olefins. More particularly, embodiments
        disclosed herein relate to\n     multi-stage polymerization processes that
        produce polymers having\n     controlled compositions and molecular weight
        with improved catalyst\n     productivity.\n<BR><BR>BACKGROUND\n<BR><BR>[0002]
        Advances in polymerization and catalysts have produced new polymers\n     having
        improved physical and mechanical properties useful in a wide\n     variety
        of products and applications. With the development of new\n     catalysts,
        the choice of polymerization, such as solution, slurry, high\n     pressure,
        or gas phase, for producing a particular polymer has been\n     greatly expanded.
        Advances in polymerization technology have also\n     provided more efficient,
        highly productive and economically enhanced\n     processes.\n<BR><BR>[0003]
        Multimodal polymers are known to be useful for making a variety of\n     commercial
        products such as films, pipe, and blow molding products. In\n     general,
        a multimodal polymer has at least two (e.g., two, three or more)\n     molecular
        weight fractions, and a molecular weight distribution that\n     determines
        a different identifiable molecular weight for each molecular\n     weight
        fraction. For example, a multimodal polymer may have at least one\n     low
        molecular weight fraction and at least one high molecular weight\n     fraction,
        and a molecular weight distribution that determines an\n     identifiable
        (relatively high) molecular weight for the high molecular\n     weight fraction
        and another identifiable (relatively low) molecular\n     weight for the low
        molecular weight fraction. A composition comprising\n     only two molecular
        weight fractions is referred to as \"bimodal.\"\n<BR><BR>[0004] A number of
        different techniques have been developed to produce\n     multimodal polymers.
        One such technique uses a suitable polymerization\n     catalyst to broaden
        the molecular weight distribution in the resultant\n     polymer. Multi-stage
        polymerization processes have also been used in\n     which different hydrogen
        concentrations may be used in the different\n     stages to broaden the molecular
        weight distribution of the resultant\n     polymer. Examples of multi-stage
        polymerization processes include\n     slurry-phase-slurry-phase processes,
        gas-phase-gas-phase processes, and\n     slurry-phase-slurry-phase processes.
        One particular process for producing\n     a bimodal polymer utilizes a loop
        reactor and a gas-phase reactor\n     arranged in series. Despite their use
        in commercial products, multimodal\n     polymers still desire improvements
        in their production processes as\n     current processes may lack adequate
        molecular weight control. Improved\n     control of molecular weight control
        may beneficial for producing\n     polyolefins suitable for a number of different
        applications, including\n     blown and cast film applications.\n<BR><BR>SUMMARY\n<BR><BR>[0005]
        Disclosed herein is an example method for producing a multi-modal\n     polyolefin
        that comprises polymerizing the multi-modal polyolefin in the\n     presence
        of a metallocene catalyst system in at least a slurry-phase\n     polymerization
        stage and a gas-phase polymerization stage arranged in\n     series in any
        order, wherein the multi-modal olefin comprises: (i) a\n     first polyolefin
        fraction having a density of less than about 940\n     kg/m.sup.3, and (ii)
        a second polyolefin fraction having a density of\n     less than about 930
        kg/m.sup.3.\n<BR><BR>[0006] Also disclosed herein is a polymer product produced
        by a\n     polymerization process that comprises polymerizing the multi-modal\n

        The invention generally relates to processes for the polymerization\n     of
        olefins. More particularly, embodiments disclosed herein relate to\n     multi-stage
        polymerization processes that produce polymers having\n     controlled compositions
        and molecular weight with improved catalyst\n     productivity.\n<BR><BR>[0015]
        Embodiments of the present invention are directed to processes for\n     the
        polymerization of olefins in a reaction sequence that comprises a\n     slurry-phase
        reactor and a gas-phase reactor arranged in series. In\n     accordance with
        present embodiments, the polymerization takes place in\n     the presence
        of a metallocene catalyst. By controlling the polymerization\n     conditions
        in the slurry-phase and gas-phase reactors, a polyolefin\n     having two
        different molecular weight fractions (also referred to as a\n     multimodal
        polymer) may be produced. For example, the concentration of\n     monomers
        and hydrogen in the slurry-phase reactor and the reactant\n     partial pressures
        in the gas-phase reactor may be controlled to produce a\n     multimodal polyolefin
        with controlled molecular weight and composition.\n     Advantageously, the
        multimodal polyolefin produced in accordance with\n     present embodiments
        may have improved flowability, for example, by\n     production of a lower
        molecular weight polyolefin in the slurry-phase\n     reactor. Improved flowability
        may be beneficial in the production of\n     films due to the resultant high
        throughput and stable behavior on the\n     film line. Improved catalyst productivity
        may also be obtained by\n     controlling the polymerization conditions in
        the slurry-phase and\n     gas-phase reactors.\n<BR><BR>[0016] It must be
        noted that, as used in the specification and the\n     appended claims, the
        singular forms \"a,\" \"an\" and \"the\" include plural\n     referents unless
        otherwise specified. Thus, for example, reference to \"a\n     leaving group\"

        one leaving group, such that the moiety may be substituted with\n     two
        or more such groups. Similarly, reference to \"a halogen atom\" as in a\n
        \    moiety \"substituted with a halogen atom\" includes more than one halogen\n
        \    atom, such that the moiety may be substituted with two or more halogen\n
        \    atoms, reference to \"a substituent\" includes one or more substituents,\n
        \    reference to \"a ligand\" includes one or more ligands, and the like.\n<BR><BR>[0017]

        or from one or more of B, C,\n     Si, Ge, N and O. Non-limiting examples
        of ring structures which may be\n     present as or part of the bridging moiety
        are cyclobutylidene,\n     cyclopentylidene, cyclohexylidene, cycloheptylidene,

        atoms are replaced by at\n     least one of Si, Ge, N and O, in particular,
        Si and Ge. The bonding\n     arrangement between the ring and the Cp groups
        may be either cis-,\n     trans-, or a combination thereof\n<BR><BR>[0029]
        The cyclic bridging groups (A) may be saturated or unsaturated\n     and/or
        carry one or more substituents and/or be fused to one or more\n     other
        ring structures. If present, the one or more substituents may be a\n     hydrocarbyl
        (e.g., alkyl such as methyl) or halogen (e.g., F, Cl) or R,\n     as defined
        above.\n<BR><BR>[0030] It is also contemplated that, the metallocene catalysts
        may include\n     their structural or optical or enantiomeric isomers (meso
        and racemic\n     isomers) and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the
        metallocene\n     compounds may be chiral and/or a bridged metallocene catalyst
        compound.\n     Further, as used herein, a single, bridged, asymmetrically
        substituted\n     metallocene catalyst component having a racemic and/or meso
        isomer does\n     not, itself, constitute at least two different bridged,

        Catalyst systems used in embodiments of the disclosed multi-stage\n     polymerization
        processes may further comprise an activator. As used\n     herein, the term
        \"activator\" refers to any compound or component, or\n     combination of

        catalyst to oligomerize or polymerize unsaturated\n     monomers, such as
        olefins. It should be understood that the metallocene\n     catalyst may be
        activated for oligomerization and/or polymerization\n     catalysis in any
        manner sufficient to allow coordination or cationic\n     oligomerization
        and or polymerization.\n<BR><BR>[0033] Aluminoxanes activators may be utilized
        as an activator.\n     Aluminoxanes may include linear, cyclic, caged, or
        polymeric structures.\n     Aluminoxanes include, for example, oligomeric
        compounds containing\n     --Al(R)--O-- subunits, where R is an alkyl group.
        In some embodiments, R\n     may be a C.sub.1 to C.sub.8 alkyl group. The
        aluminoxanes may contain\n     linear, cyclic, caged, and/or cross-linked
        species. Examples of\n     aluminoxanes include methylaluminoxane (\"MAO\"),
        modified\n     methylaluminoxane (\"MMAO\"), ethylalumoxane, and isobutylalumoxane.
        In\n     some embodiments, alkylaluminoxanes and modified alkylaluminoxanes
        are\n     suitable as catalyst activators, particularly when the abstractable\n

        using one of the support methods well known in the art\n     or as described
        below. In one particular embodiment, a metallocene\n     catalyst is used
        in a supported form. For example, the metallocene\n     catalyst may be used
        in a supported form wherein the metallocene catalyst\n     is deposited on,
        contacted with, or incorporated within, adsorbed or\n     absorbed in, or
        on a support or carrier.\n<BR><BR>[0040] As used herein, the term \"support\"
        and \"carrier\" are used\n     interchangeably and refer to any porous or
        non-porous support material,\n     including porous support materials such
        as talc, inorganic oxides and\n     inorganic chlorides. Other carriers include
        resinous support materials\n     such as polystyrene divinyl benzene polyolefins
        or polymeric compounds,\n     or any other organic or inorganic support material
        and the like, or\n     mixtures thereof\n<BR><BR>[0041] Examples of suitable
        supports are inorganic oxides that include\n     those Group 2, 3, 4, 5, 13
        or 14 metal oxides. Specific examples of\n     suitable supports include silica,
        alumina, silica-alumina, magnesium\n     chloride, and mixtures thereof. Other
        useful supports include magnesia,\n     titania, zirconia, montmorillonite
        (EP-B1 0 511 665) and the like. Also,\n     combinations of these support
        materials may be used, for example,\n     silica-chromium, silica-alumina,
        silica-titania and the like.\n<BR><BR>[0042] In some embodiments, the support,
        such as an inorganic oxide, has a\n     surface area in the range of from
        about 10 to about 700 m.sup.2/g, pore\n     volume in the range of from about
        0.1 to about 4.0 cc/g and average\n     particle size in the range of from
        about 5 to about 500 .mu.m. In\n     additional embodiments, the surface area
        of the support is in the range\n     of from about 50 to about 500 m.sup.2/g,
        pore volume of from about 0.5 to\n     about 3.5 cc/g and average particle
        size of from about 10 to about 200\n     .mu.m. In yet additional embodiments,
        the surface area of the support is\n     from about 100 to about 400 m.sup.2/g,
        pore volume from about 0.8 to\n     about 3.0 cc/g and average particle size
        is from about 5 to about 100\n     .mu.m. The average pore size of the support
        may be in the range of from\n     10 to 1000 A, 50 to about 500 A, or 75 to

        the metallocene catalyst may be deposited on the\n     same or separate supports
        together with an activator, or the activator\n     may be used in an unsupported
        form, or may be deposited on a support\n     different from the supported
        metallocene catalyst, or any combination\n     thereof\n<BR><BR>[0045] There
        are various other methods in the art for supporting a\n     polymerization
        catalyst compound or catalyst system of the invention. For\n     example,
        the metallocene catalyst may contain a polymer bound ligand as\n     described
        in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,473,202 and 5,770,755, the metallocene\n     catalyst
        may be spray dried as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,310, the\n     support
        used with the metallocene catalyst may be functionalized as\n     described
        in EP-A-0 802 203, or at least one substituent or leaving group\n     is selected
        as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,880.\n<BR><BR>[0046] In some embodiments,
        a supported metallocene catalyst system may be\n     used that includes an
        antistatic agent or surface modifier that is used\n     in the preparation
        of the supported catalyst system as described in WO\n     96/11960. The catalyst
        systems may be prepared in the presence of an\n     olefin, for example hexene-1.\n<BR><BR>[0047]
        In some embodiments, a method for producing the supported\n     metallocene
        catalyst system is described in WO 96/00245 and WO 96/00243.\n     In this
        method, the metallocene catalyst is slurried in a liquid to form\n     a metallocene
        solution and a separate solution is formed containing an\n     activator and
        a liquid. The liquid may be any compatible solvent or other\n     liquid capable
        of forming a solution or the like with the cyclic bridged\n     metallocene
        catalyst compounds and/or activator of the invention. In one\n     particular
        embodiment, the liquid is a cyclic aliphatic or aromatic\n     hydrocarbon,
        such as toluene. The metallocene catalyst and activator\n     solutions are
        mixed together and added to a porous support or the porous\n     support is
        added to the solutions such that the total volume of the\n     metallocene
        catalyst solution and the activator solution or the\n     metallocene catalyst
        and activator solution is less than four times the\n     pore volume of the
        porous support, more preferably less than three times,\n     even more preferably
        less than two times; preferred ranges being from 1.1\n     times to 3.5 times
        range and most preferably in the 1.2 to 3 times range.\n     Another preferred
        method is to pre-react the porous support with an\n     activator in a hydrocarbon
        diluent. The hydrocarbon solution of the\n     metallocene catalyst is added
        later to complete the catalyst preparation.\n<BR><BR>[0048] Procedures for
        measuring the total pore volume of a porous support\n     are well known in
        the art. Details of one of these procedures are\n     discussed in Volume
        1, Experimental Methods in Catalytic Research\n     (Academic Press, 1968)
        (specifically see pages 67-96). This preferred\n     procedure involves the
        use of a classical BET apparatus for nitrogen\n     absorption. Another method
        well known in the art is described in Innes,\n     Total Porosity and Particle
        Density of Fluid Catalysts By Liquid\n     Titration, Vol. 28, No. 3, Analytical
        Chemistry 332-334 (March, 1956).\n<BR><BR>[0049] The mole ratio of the metal
        of the activator component to the metal\n     of the supported cyclic bridged
        metallocene catalyst compounds may be in\n     the range of between 0.3:1
        to 1000:1, preferably 20:1 to 800:1, and most\n     preferably 50:1 to 500:1.
        Where the activator is an ionizing activator\n     such as those based on
        the anion tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)boron, the\n     mole ratio of the metal
        of the activator component to the metal component\n     of the cyclic bridged
        metallocene catalyst may be in the range of between\n     0.3:1 to 3:1. Where
        an unsupported cyclic bridged metallocene catalyst is\n     utilized, the
        mole ratio of the metal of the activator component to the\n     metal of the
        cyclic bridged metallocene catalyst may be in the range of\n     between 0.3:1
        to 10,000:1, 100:1 to 5000:1, or 500:1 to 2000:1.\n<BR><BR>[0050] In one particular
        embodiment, the catalyst system comprises a\n     metallocene catalyst as
        described herein activated by methylaluminoxane\n     (MAO) and supported
        by silica. While conventionally, MAO is combined with\n     a metallocene
        catalyst and then the combination is deposited on silica,\n     in some embodiments,
        the activator (e.g. MAO) and the support (e.g.\n     silica) may be first
        combined and then combined with the metallocene\n     catalyst. Modified MAO
        (MMAO) or a combination of MAO and MMAO may also\n     be used. In one embodiment,
        the catalyst compound comprises\n     Me.sub.2Si(H.sub.4Ind)ZrCl.sub.2, where
        Me is methyl and H.sub.4Ind is\n     tetrahydroindenyl.\n<BR><BR>[0051] In
        another particular embodiment, the catalyst system comprises a\n     metallocene
        catalyst as described herein activated by methylaluminoxane\n     (MAO) and
        supported by silica. While conventionally, MAO is combined with\n     a metallocene
        catalyst and then the combination is deposited on silica,\n     in some embodiments,
        the activator (e.g. MAO) and the support (e.g.\n     silica) may be first
        combined and then combined with the metallocene\n     catalyst. Modified MAO
        (MMAO) or a combination of MAO and MMAO may also\n     be used. In one embodiment,
        the catalyst compound comprises\n     (C.sub.5H.sub.3Me n-Bu).sub.2ZrCl.sub.2,
        where Me is methyl n-Bu is\n     n-butyl.\n<BR><BR>[0052] In one embodiment
        the metallocene catalyst is used in an\n     unsupported form, preferably
        in a liquid form such as described in U.S.\n     Pat. Nos. 5,317,036 and 5,693,727,
        and EP-A-0 593 083. The metallocene\n     catalyst in liquid form can be fed
        to a reactor as described in WO\n     97/46599.\n<BR><BR>[0053] In one embodiment,
        the metallocene catalyst may be combined with a\n     carboxylic acid salt
        of a metal ester, for example aluminum carboxylates\n     such as aluminum
        mono, di- and tri-stearates, aluminum octoates, oleates\n     and cyclohexylbutyrates,
        as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,300,436 and\n     7,354,880.\n<BR><BR>Multi-Stage
        Polymerization Process\n<BR><BR>[0054] Embodiments for producing polyolefins
        disclosed herein may utilize\n     a multi-stage polymerization process. The
        polymerization process may be\n     carried out, for example, in a series
        of polymerization stages selected\n     from the group of slurry-phase and
        gas-phase polymerization stages. In\n     some embodiments, the polymerization
        process may comprise a slurry-phase\n     reactor and a gas-phase reactor
        arranged in series. Embodiments of the\n     process may comprise more than
        one slurry-phase reactor and more than one\n     gas-phase reactor, for example,
        up to 10 slurry-phase reactors and 5\n     gas-phase reactors may be used.
        Example multi-stage polymerization\n     processes are described in more detail
        in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,552,150 and\n     7,576,166 and U.S. Patent Publication
        No. 2011/028827.\n<BR><BR>[0055] The processes described herein are suitable
        for the production of\n     homopolymers of olefins, including ethylene and/or
        propylene, and/or\n     copolymers, terpolymers, and the like, of olefins,
        including polymers\n     comprising ethylene and/or propylene and at least
        one or more other\n     olefins (also referred to as a co-monomer). In an
        embodiment, the olefin\n     is a monomer selected from the group consisting
        of ethylene, propylene,\n     and any combination thereof. In some embodiments,
        the ethylene content of\n     the polyethylene prepared by the processes disclosed
        herein may be at\n     least about 50% by weight of the total monomers involved.
        The term\n     \"polyethylene\" when used herein is used generically to refer
        to any or\n     all of the polymers comprising ethylene.\n<BR><BR>[0056] One
        or more co-monomers may be employed at any stage of the\n     polymerization
        process. The co-monomers may be alpha-olefins. The\n     co-monomers, for
        example, may contain from 2 to 16 carbon atoms in one\n     embodiment. In
        other embodiments, ethylene and a co-monomer comprising\n     from 3 to 12
        carbon atoms, or from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, or from 4 to 8\n     carbon atoms,
        may be used. Specific examples of co-monomers that may be\n     used herein
        include ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene,\n     1-heptene,
        1-octene, 4-methylpent-1-ene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene,\n     1-hexadecene and
        the like. Also usable are polyenes such as\n     1,3-hexadiene, 1,4-hexadiene,
        cyclopentadiene, dicyclopentadiene,\n     4-vinylcyclohex-1-ene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene,
        5-vinylidene-2-norbornene and\n     5-vinyl-2-norbornene, and olefins formed
        in situ in the polymerization\n     medium. When olefins are formed in situ
        in the polymerization medium, the\n     formation of polyolefins containing
        long chain branching may occur. The\n     content of the co-monomer (e.g.,
        the alpha-olefin) incorporated into the\n     copolymer may be no greater
        than 30 mole percent (\"mol %\") in total, or\n     may be from 3 to 20 mol
        %.\n<BR><BR>[0057] Hydrogen may also be used at any stage of the polymerization\n
        \    process. Hydrogen is often used in olefin polymerization to control the\n
        \    final properties of the polyolefin. Increasing the concentration (partial\n
        \    pressure) of hydrogen may increase the melt flow rate (MFR) and/or melt\n
        \    index (MI) of the polyolefin generated. The MFR or MI can thus be\n     influenced
        by the hydrogen concentration. The amount of hydrogen in the\n     polymerization
        may be expressed as a mole ratio relative to the total\n     polymerizable
        monomer, for example, ethylene, or a blend of ethylene and\n     hexene or
        propylene. In an embodiment, the amount of hydrogen used in the\n     polymerization
        processes is an amount sufficient to achieve the desired\n     MFR or MI of
        the final polyolefin resin. Melt flow rate for polypropylene\n     may be
        measured according to ASTM D 1238 (230.degree. C. with 2.16 kg\n     weight);
        melt index (I.sub.2) for polyethylene may be measured according\n     to ASTM
        D 1238 (190.degree. C. with 2.16 kg weight).\n<BR><BR>[0058] As previously
        mentioned, the multi-stage reaction may comprise two\n     or more polymerization
        stages arranged in series. By way of example, a\n     first slurry-phase reaction
        stage may be carried out in one or more\n     slurry-phase reactors, and a
        second gas-phase reaction stage may be\n     carried out in one or more gas-phase
        reactors. In the first reaction\n     stage, an olefin, optionally hydrogen,
        and/or an optional co-monomer may\n     be subjected to a first polymerization
        reaction to produce a first\n     polyolefin fraction. A reactor effluent
        comprising the first\n     polymerization fraction may be recovered from the
        slurry-phase reaction\n     stage and fed to the gas-phase reaction stage
        with additional olefin,\n     optional hydrogen, and optional co-monomer also
        being fed to the\n     gas-phase stage. The additional olefin, optional hydrogen,
        and optional\n     co-monomer may then be subjected to a second polymerization
        reaction in\n     the presence of the first polymerization fraction to produce
        a second\n     polyolefin fraction. A reactor effluent comprising the first
        and second\n     polymerization fractions may be recovered from the gas-phase\n
        \    polymerization stage.\n<BR><BR>[0059] The slurry-phase polymerization
        stage may include any known reactor\n     suitable for use in slurry-phase
        polymerization. This type of reactor,\n     and means for operating the reactor
        are well known. Examples of suitable\n     reactors include continuous stirred
        tank reactors and loop reactors. In\n     loop reactors, the slurry may be
        circulated with a high velocity along a\n     closed pipe by using a circulation
        pump. More than one slurry-phase\n     reactor may be used in series. For
        example, the polymer suspension\n     produced in the polymerization reaction
        in an inert hydrocarbon may be\n     fed without separation of inert components
        and monomers to the following\n     slurry-phase reactor, either periodically
        or continuously. The following\n     slurry-phase reactor may act at a lower
        temperature and pressure than the\n     previous slurry-phase reactor.\n<BR><BR>[0060]
        In some embodiments, a slurry comprising an olefin and a diluent,\n     such
        as a hydrocarbon diluent, may be fed to the slurry-phase reaction\n     stage.
        Optionally, the slurry may further comprise the hydrogen and\n     co-monomer.
        Examples of suitable hydrocarbon diluents include C.sub.3 to\n     C.sub.8
        hydrocarbons such as propane, propylene, n-butane, isobutane,\n     hexanes
        such as n-hexane and isohexanes, heptanes, octanes, and mixtures\n     thereof.
        In some embodiments, the diluent may be a low boiling point\n     hydrocarbon
        having form 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a mixture of such\n     hydrocarbons. In
        particular embodiments, the diluent may comprise propane\n     with minor
        amounts of methane, ethane, and/or butane.\n<BR><BR>[0061] The concentration
        of the olefin, hydrogen, and/or co-monomer in the\n     slurry may be adjusted
        to control properties of the polymer product, such\n     as the molecular
        weight and composition. Higher concentrations of\n     hydrogen produce homopolymers
        or copolymers of lower molecular weight and\n     therefore higher MFR or
        MI. For co-polymerization, the density of the\n     polymer product is related
        to the concentration of co-monomer with the\n     polymer density decreasing
        with increasing co-monomer concentration. The\n     olefin may be present
        in the slurry in an amount from about 2 mol % to\n     about 50 mol %, about
        3 mol % to about 20 mol %, or about 3 mol % to\n     about 10 mol %. For producing
        propylene homopolymer, the polymerization\n     may be run in liquid propylene
        with hydrogen for molecular weight\n     control. Higher olefin content may
        increase catalyst productivity, but\n     can require more ethylene recycle
        than if a lower concentration was used.\n     Where used, the mole ratio of
        co-monomer to olefin is in the range of\n     about 0.01 to 1.0, or about
        0.05 to 0.6 and is determined by the density\n     of polymer to be made and
        the incorporation efficiency of the catalyst.\n     Where used, the hydrogen
        may be present in the slurry in ratio to\n     ethylene expressed in molar
        parts per million of hydrogen to olefin in\n     mole percent in the range
        of about 1.0 to 25 or from about 1.5 to 15 or\n     from about 2 to 10. For
        the slurry reactor, control of the polymer\n     density may be primarily
        controlled by the ratio of co-monomer to monomer\n     and the MI by the ratio
        of hydrogen to monomer. Embodiments may use\n     higher reactor temperatures
        to achieve higher MI and higher density at\n     the same concentrations of
        monomer, co-monomer and hydrogen. Control of\n     reactor temperature and
        monomer, co-monomer and hydrogen may be used to\n     produce the desired
        copolymer properties.\n<BR><BR>[0062] In one embodiment, the one or more reactors
        in the slurry-phase\n     polymerization stage may have a temperature ranging
        from about 50.degree.\n     C. to about 115.degree. C., from about 60.degree.
        C. to about 110.degree.\n     C., or from about 70.degree. C. to about 100.degree.
        C. In one\n     embodiment, the one or more reactors in the slurry-phase polymerization\n
        \    stage may have a pressure ranging from 1 bar to 150 bar or from 1 bar
        to\n     100 bar or from about 5 bar to 70 bar.\n<BR><BR>[0063] A reactor
        effluent comprising the first polyolefin fraction\n     produced in the slurry-phase
        polymerization stage may be withdrawn and\n     transferred to a gas-phase
        polymerization stage, which may comprise one\n     or more gas-phase polymerization
        reactors. The first polyolefin fraction\n     may be withdrawn from the slurry-phase
        polymerization stage, either\n     intermittently or continuously. In some
        embodiments, the pressure of the\n     first polymerization product and the
        slurry including the diluent and\n     optional hydrogen may be reduced after
        the slurry-phase polymerization\n     stage to evaporate volatile components
        such as the residual hydrogen and\n     diluent from the reactor effluent.
        The residual hydrogen and diluent may\n     be recycled for reuse in the slurry-phase
        polymerization stage.\n<BR><BR>[0064] In general, the gas-phase polymerization
        stage may be a continuous\n     gas-phase process, such as a fluid-bed process.
        In an embodiment, a\n     fluid-bed reactor may have a reaction zone and a
        velocity reduction zone\n     (i.e., disengagement zone). The reaction zone
        includes a bed of growing\n     polymer particles, formed polymer particles
        and a minor amount of\n     catalyst particles fluidized by the continuous
        flow of the gaseous\n     monomer and diluent to remove heat of polymerization
        through the reaction\n     zone. Optionally, some or all of the recirculated
        gases may be cooled and\n     compressed to form liquids in the circulating
        gas that increase the heat\n     removal capacity of the circulating gas stream
        when readmitted to the\n     reaction zone. A suitable rate of gas flow may
        be readily determined by\n     simple experiment. Makeup of gaseous monomer
        may be added to the\n     circulating gas stream at a rate equal to the rate
        at which particulate\n     polymer product and monomer associated therewith
        is withdrawn from the\n     reactor, and the composition of the gas passing
        through the reactor is\n     adjusted to maintain an essentially steady state
        gaseous composition\n     within the reaction zone. The second polyolefin
        fraction produced in the\n     gas-phase reactor and the first polyolefin
        fraction may be withdrawn from\n     the reaction zone, either intermittently
        or continuously. The gas leaving\n     the reaction zone is passed to the
        velocity reduction zone where\n     entrained particles are removed. Finer
        entrained particles and dust may\n     be removed in a cyclone and/or fine
        filter. The gas is passed through a\n     heat exchanger wherein the heat
        of polymerization is removed, compressed\n     in a compressor and then returned
        to the reaction zone.\n<BR><BR>[0065] Useful gas phase polymerization processes
        include those that\n     utilize a fluidized bed reactor. This type reactor,
        and means for\n     operating the reactor, are well known and are described
        in, for example,\n     U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,709,853; 4,003,712; 4,011,382; 4,302,566;
        4,543,399;\n     4,882,400; 5,352,749; 5,541,270; EP-A-0 802 202. These patents
        disclose\n     gas phase polymerization processes wherein the polymerization
        medium is\n     either mechanically agitated or fluidized by the continuous
        flow of the\n     gaseous monomer and diluent.\n<BR><BR>[0066] In one embodiment,
        the one or more reactors in the gas phase or\n     fluidized bed polymerization
        stage may have a pressure ranging from about\n     0.7 to about 70 bar or
        from about 5 bar to about 50 bar or from about 10\n     bar to 30 bar. In
        one embodiment, the one or more reactors may have a\n     temperature ranging
        from about 10.degree. C. to about 150.degree. C., or\n     from about 50.degree.
        C. to about 115.degree. C. In an embodiment, the\n     reactor temperature
        may be operated at the highest feasible temperature\n     taking into account
        the sintering temperature of the polymer within the\n     reactor. In embodiments,
        the superficial gas velocity in the one or more\n     reactors may range from
        about 0.2 to about 1.1 meters/second (about 0.7\n     to about 3.5 feet/second),
        or from about 0.3 to about 0.9 meters/second\n     (about 1.0 to about 2.7
        feet/second) or from about 0.5 to 0.8\n     meters/second (about 1.6 to about
        2.6 feet/second). In embodiments,\n     stirred or fluidized bed gas phase
        polymerization systems may be used.\n<BR><BR>[0067] The concentration of the
        olefin, hydrogen, and/or co-monomer in the\n     gas-phase in the gas-phase
        reactor may be adjusted to control properties\n     of the polymer product,
        such as the molecular weight by adjusting the\n     hydrogen to olefin ratio
        and composition by adjusting the co-monomer to\n     olefin ratio. By maintaining
        the olefin concentration and ratios of\n     co-monomer to olefin and hydrogen
        to olefin constant as well as\n     maintaining a constant reactor temperature
        are required to produce a\n     polymer or copolymer with consistent and uniform
        properties. The olefin\n     may be present in the gas phase in an amount
        from about 5 mole % to about\n     80 mole %, about 10 mole % to about 70
        mole % by mole, or about 30% mole\n     % to about 70 mole %. Where used,
        the co-monomer may be present in the\n     gas phase in an amount in mole
        ratio to the olefin from about 0.005 to\n     about 0.25 or from about 0.03
        to about 0.08 mole co-monomer to mole\n     olefin. Where used, the hydrogen
        may be present in the gas phase in an\n     amount in ratio to the olefin
        in molar parts per million to olefin mole\n     percent (ppm/mol %) of from
        about 1.0 to about 16.0 or from about 1.5 to\n     about 10.0.\n<BR><BR>[0068]
        The partial pressures of the olefin, hydrogen, and/or co-monomer in\n     the
        gas-phase in the gas-phase reactor may be adjusted to control\n     properties
        of the polymer product, such as the molecular weight and\n     composition.
        Olefin partial pressure in a gas phase reactor are generally\n     in the
        range of from about 5 bar to about 50 bar or from about 6 bar to\n     about
        25 bar or from about 8 to about 20 bar. Where used, the co-monomer\n     may
        be present in the gas phase in an amount in mole ratio to the olefin\n     from
        about 0.005 to about 0.40 or from about 0.01 to about 0.25 mole\n     co-monomer
        to mole olefin. Where used, the hydrogen may be present in the\n     gas phase
        in an amount in ratio to the olefin in molar parts per million\n     to olefin
        mole percent (ppm/mol %) of from about 1.0 to about 30.0 or\n     from about
        1.5 to about 20.0. In embodiments, one or more olefins,\n     including ethylene
        or propylene or combinations thereof, may be\n     prepolymerized in the presence
        of a metallocene catalyst system prior to\n     the main polymerization. The
        prepolymerization may be carried out\n     batch-wise or continuously in gas,
        solution or slurry phase, including at\n     elevated pressures. The prepolymerization
        may take place with any olefin\n     monomer or combination and/or in the
        presence of any molecular weight\n     controlling agent such as hydrogen.
        Co-monomers may also be used in the\n     prepolymerization. For examples
        of prepolymerization procedures, see U.S.\n     Pat. Nos. 4,748,221; 4,789,359;
        4,923,833; 4,921,825; 5,283,278; and\n     5,705,578 and European publication
        EP-B-0279 863 and WO 97/44371. In\n     embodiments, the metallocene catalyst
        system may all be fed into the\n     prepolymerization stage. However, portions
        of the metallocenes catalyst\n     system and cocatalyst, if any, may also
        be fed into the other\n     polymerization stages, as desired for a particular
        application.\n<BR><BR>[0069] Processes disclosed herein may optionally use
        inert particulate\n     materials as fluidization aids in the gas phase polymerization
        reactor.\n     These inert particulate materials can include carbon black,
        silica, talc,\n     and clays, as well as inert polymeric materials. Carbon
        black, for\n     example, has a primary particle size of about 10 nanometers
        to about 100\n     nanometers, an average size of aggregate of about 0.1 microns
        to about 30\n     microns, and a specific surface area from about 30 m.sup.2/g
        to about\n     1500 m.sup.2/g. Silica has a primary particle size of about
        5 nanometers\n     to about 50 nanometers, an average size of aggregate of

        about 50 m.sup.2/g\n     to about 500 m.sup.2/g. Clay, talc, and polymeric

        These inert\n     particulate materials may be used in amounts ranging from
        about 0.3% to\n     about 80%, or from about 5% to about 50%, based on the
        weight of the\n     final product. They are especially useful for the polymerization
        of\n     sticky polymers as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,994,534 and 5,304,588.\n<BR><BR>[0070]
        Chain transfer agents, promoters, scavenging agents and other\n     additives
        may be, and often are, used in the multi-stage polymerization\n     processes
        disclosed herein. Chain transfer agents are often used to\n     control polymer
        molecular weight. Examples of these compounds are\n     hydrogen and metal
        alkyls of the general formula M.sup.xR.sub.y, where M\n     is a Group 3-12
        metal, x is the oxidation state of the metal, typically\n     1, 2, 3, 4,
        5 or 6, each R is independently an alkyl or aryl, and y is 0,\n     1, 2,
        3, 4, 5, or 6. In some embodiments, a zinc alkyl is used, such as\n     diethyl
        zinc. Typical promoters may include halogenated hydrocarbons such\n     as
        CHCl.sub.3, CFCl.sub.3, CH.sub.3--CCl.sub.3, CF.sub.2Cl--CCl.sub.3,\n     and
        ethyltrichloroacetate. Such promoters are described in, for example,\n     U.S.
        Pat. No. 4,988,783. Other organometallic compounds such as\n     scavenging
        agents for poisons may also be used to increase catalyst\n     activity. Examples
        of these compounds include metal alkyls, such as\n     aluminum alkyls, for
        example, triisobutylaluminum. Some compounds may be\n     used to neutralize
        static in the fluidized-bed reactor, others known as\n     drivers rather
        than antistatic agents, may consistently force the static\n     from positive
        to negative or from negative to positive. The use of these\n     additives
        is well within the skill of those skilled in the art. These\n     additives
        may be added to the circulation loops, riser, and/or downer\n     separately
        or independently from the catalyst, or as part of the catalyst\n<BR><BR>[0071]

        of the multi-stage polymerization processes may be used\n     to produce a

        of olefins, including ethylene and/or propylene,\n     and/or copolymers,
        terpolymers, and the like, of olefins, including\n     polymers comprising

        In some embodiments,\n     the second polyolefin fraction may have a density
        ranging from about 905\n     kg/m.sup.3 to about 930 kg/m.sup.3 or from about
        915 kg/m.sup.3 to about\n     925 kg/m.sup.3. The second polyolefin fraction
        produced in the gas-phase\n     polymerization may have, for example, a melt

        and from about 80% to about 50% of the second\n     polyolefin fraction. In
        other embodiments, the polyolefins may contain,\n     for example, from about

        for example, in the range from 0.01\n     dg/min to 10 dg/min. In other embodiments,
        the polymers may have a melt\n     index of from about 0.1 dg/min to about
        5 dg/min or from about 0.5 dg/min\n     to about 3 dg/min. For example, the
        polymer may have a melt index of\n     about 3 dg/min or less or of about
        1 dg/min or less.\n<BR><BR>[0079] The polymers of the invention in an embodiment
        may have a melt\n     index ratio (I.sub.21/I.sub.2) (121 is measured by ASTM-D-1238-F,\n
        \    [190.degree. C./21.6 kg]), for example, of from 15 to 30. In other\n
        \    embodiments, the polymers may have an melt index ratio of from 17 to

        of products and end-use\n     applications. The polymers produced by the process
        of the invention may\n     include, but are not limited to, linear low density

        embodiments of the\n     present invention may be used to produce a polymer
        product characterized\n     by a low gel count. By way of example, the polymer
        products comprising\n     the polyolefins may have a gel count of about 300
        gels per square meter\n     or less in one embodiment. The gel count of the

        polymerized in a bench-scale slurry-phase reactor\n     using either Catalyst
        A or Catalyst B (comparative). A series of runs was\n     conducted using
        either Catalyst A or Catalyst B. For each run, the slurry\n     comprised
        ethylene and a co-monomer in a propane diluent (1350 ml). The\n     co-monomer
        included in the slurry was 1-hexene (37 ml). The ethylene\n     concentration
        in the loop reactor was 12 mol %. The reactor was operated\n     at 80.degree.
        C. and 38 bar pressure. The polymerizations were each\n     conducted for
        60 minutes. In contrast to Catalyst B, Catalyst A was\n     observed to have
        process stability in that there was no activity decay\n     during the 60
        minute polymerization.\n<BR><BR>[0086] FIG. 1 is a graph showing MFR (190.degree.
        C./2.16 kg) of the\n     resultant polymer versus activity of the catalyst

        for the polyethylene\n     according to ASTM D 1238 (190.degree. C./2.16 kg).
        Activity is measured\n     in kilograms of polyethylene per gram of polymerization
        catalyst-hour.\n     From FIG. 1, it can be seen that the metallocene catalyst

        in a pilot-scale multi-stage\n     polymerization process using either Catalyst
        A or Catalyst B. A loop\n     reactor was operated at 85.degree. C. and 65
        bar pressure. Into the loop\n     reactor, ethylene, a co-monomer (1-butene),
        a propane diluent, and a\n     polymerization catalyst were added so that
        a target of 35 kg/hr of\n     polyethylene was produced. Hydrogen was added
        to the loop reactor for\n     certain runs with Catalyst A to produce a polymer
        with an MFR\n     (190.degree. C./2.16 kg) in the range of 0.8 to 1.2 but
        not with Catalyst\n     B. Trisiobutylaluminum was added at a rate of 0.5
        g/hr. The concentration\n     of ethylene in the loop reactor was from 4-5
        mol %. The mole ratio of the\n     1-butene co-monomer to ethylene in the
        loop reactor was 50 mol/kmol. The\n     residence time in the loop reactor
        was 60 minutes. The polymer containing\n     the polymerization catalyst was
        separated from the reaction media and\n     transferred to a gas-phase reactor
        where additional ethylene, 1-hexene\n     co-monomer, and hydrogen (for Catalyst
        A runs) were added so that a\n     target of 35 kg/hr of polyethylene was
        produced. The gas-phase reactor\n     was operated at 80.degree. C. and 20
        bar pressure with an ethylene\n     concentration of 30 mol %. The mole ratio
        of the 1-hexene co-monomer to\n     ethylene in the gas-phase reactor was
        50 mol/kmol. Trisiobutylaluminum\n     was added at a rate of 2 g/hr. The
        residence time in the gas-phase\n     reactor was 3 hours. The target production
        rate for the overall process\n     was 70 kg/hr. The target MFR (190.degree.
        C./2.16 kg) of the resultant\n     polymer was 1 g/10 min. The target density
        of the resultant polymer was\n     918 g/cm.sup.3.\n<BR><BR>[0089] The polyethylene

        As previously mentioned,\n     no hydrogen was used for the runs with Catalyst
        B. Catalyst productivity\n     is measured in kilograms of polyethylene per
