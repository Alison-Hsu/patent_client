        \      <p> A method and system for predictively controlling environmental
        conditions\n     of multiple occupancy zones in an occupancy space are provided.
        Occupancy\n     and environmental conditions of each of the occupancy zones
        are detected\n     and identified. The detected occupancy is stored in an
        occupancy\n     database. Patterns of occupancy of each of the occupancy zones
        are\n     determined using the occupancy database. Future occupancy of the\n
        \    occupancy zones is predicted based on the occupancy patterns of the\n
        \    occupancy zones. The environmental conditions of the occupancy zones
        are\n     controlled based on the detected occupancy and/or the predicted
        future\n     occupancy. The environmental conditions of the occupancy zones
        in the\n     occupancy space are thereby predictively controlled by simultaneously\n
        \    incorporating an occupant's desired settings, existing and historical\n
        \    temperature data within the occupancy space, and weather data. The\n
        \    predicted occupancy can be combined with demand response signal and\n
        \    energy tier rates to make optimal conditioning decisions.\n</p>\n       <HR>\n<TABLE

        <HR> <BR><BR>BACKGROUND\n<BR><BR> The method and system disclosed herein,
        in general, relates to heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.
        \ More particularly, the method and system disclosed herein relates to predictively
        controlling environmental conditions of\nmultiple occupancy zones in an occupancy
        space.\n<BR><BR> A private residential or small commercial building typically
        uses a single thermostat for controlling the temperature of the building space.
        \ The temperature may be sensed and controlled in areas within the building
        space that are least likely\nto be occupied.  If the entire building space
        is conditioned irrespective of actual occupancy by the occupants, conditioning
        of unoccupied parts of the building space leads to inefficient use of energy.
        \ Moreover, the building space is conditioned\naccording to the temperature
        around a single thermostat, resulting in uneven conditioning of the building
        space.  The uneven conditioning of the building space is exacerbated by leakage
        of heat from peripheral areas of the building.  The temperature set\non the
        single thermostat may not be comfortable for occupants occupying different
        areas of the building space and therefore there may be a need to frequently
        reset the temperature, which results in consumption of additional energy.
        \ Generally,\nprogrammable thermostats currently available are designed to
        adjust the temperature of the building space based on settings programmed
        by a user.  The settings take effect at various times of the day to cater
        to different temperatures and comfort levels\nof the occupants.  Furthermore,
        the programmable thermostats that are available require the user to be familiar
        with programming configurations to program the thermostat based on the comfort
        levels.  The programming configurations may be complex.\n<BR><BR> Furthermore,
        if the occupants return to their private residence after spending a day outside,
        the residential building space may not be conditioned upon the arrival of
        the occupants.  The occupants must first occupy the building space and then\nwait
        for the building space to be conditioned.  While the occupants wait for the
        building space to be conditioned, they may have to bear uncomfortable environmental
        conditions, for example, extreme heat or extreme cold.  Therefore, there is
        a need for\npredicting occupancy of the building space and conditioning the
        building space prior to occupancy by the occupants.\n<BR><BR> Hence, there
        is long felt but unresolved need for a user friendly HVAC system that attains
        maximum comfort levels and efficiently utilizes energy resources by predictively
        controlling environmental conditions of multiple occupancy zones in an\noccupancy
        space.\n<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR> This summary is provided
        to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further
        described in the detailed description of the invention.  This summary is not
        intended to identify key or essential inventive concepts of the\nclaimed subject
        matter, nor is it intended for determining the scope of the claimed subject
        matter.\n<BR><BR> The method and system disclosed herein addresses the above
        stated need for a user friendly heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
        (HVAC) system that attains maximum comfort levels and efficiently utilizes
        energy resources by predictively\ncontrolling environmental conditions of
        multiple occupancy zones in an occupancy space.  Occupancy and environmental
        conditions of the occupancy zones are detected and identified.  The detected
        occupancy of each of the occupancy zones is stored in an\noccupancy database.
        \ Patterns of occupancy of each of the occupancy zones over a predetermined
        duration, for example, over a day or a week, are determined using, for example,
        the historical data and detected occupancy stored in the occupancy database.
        \nFuture occupancy of the occupancy zones is predicted based on the determined
        patterns of occupancy of each of the occupancy zones.  The environmental conditions
        of the occupancy zones in the occupancy space are controlled based on the
        detected occupancy\nand the predicted future occupancy of the occupancy zones.
        \ One or more occupancy and environmental sensor motes and one or more actuators
        are provided in each of the occupancy zones for detecting and predictively
        controlling environmental conditions in\neach of the occupancy zones.  The
        controlled environmental conditions are displayed on a graphical user interface,
        for example, by overlaying temperature heat maps and occupancy maps on a floor
        plan of the occupancy space.\n<BR><BR> In an embodiment, the control of the
        environmental conditions in the occupancy zones in the occupancy space is
        determined based on class and attributes of an occupant in each of the occupancy
        zones.  An infrared image of the occupant in each of\nthe occupancy zones
        is captured.  The infrared image information of the captured image is digitized
        to obtain a thermal signature of the occupant.  The thermal signature of the
        occupant is compared with thermal signatures of multiple occupants stored
        in\na thermal signature database for determining the class and attributes
        of the occupant.  The environmental conditions of the occupancy zones are
        predictively controlled based on one or more of the detected occupancy, the
        predicted future occupancy, and\nthe determined class and attributes of the
        occupant.  The environmental conditions of the occupancy zones in the occupancy
        space are thereby predictively controlled by simultaneously incorporating
        an occupant's desired settings, existing and historical\ntemperature data
        within the occupancy space, and weather data.\n<BR><BR> The environmental
        conditions of the occupancy space are controlled based on multiple present
        and forecast, internal and external environmental conditions and the predicted
        future occupancy in the occupancy zones.  The forecast external\nenvironmental
        conditions comprise, for example, regional weather forecasts for short and
        long durations of time.  In an embodiment, multiple control parameters are
        combined to predictively control the environmental conditions in each of the
        occupancy\nzones.  The predicted occupancy can be combined with, for example,
        demand response signal and energy tier rates to make optimal conditioning
        decisions. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n<BR><BR> The foregoing
        summary, as well as the following detailed description of the invention, is

        INVENTION\n<BR><BR> FIG. 1 illustrates a method for predictively controlling
        environmental conditions of multiple occupancy zones in an occupancy space.
        \ As used herein, \"occupancy space\" refers to an enclosed space that may
        be occupied by animate or inanimate\noccupants.  A single occupancy space
        may be divided into two or more occupancy zones.  For example, if a building
        space comprising multiple rooms is considered an occupancy space, each of
        the rooms in the building may be considered an occupancy zone.  In\nanother
        example, a large hall may be considered an occupancy space and multiple areas
        thereof may be considered as occupancy zones.  The occupancy spaces and the
        occupancy zones may be enclosed indoor spaces or physically unbounded outdoor
        spaces.\n<BR><BR> Also, as used herein, \"occupant class\" refers to the general
        class of an occupant, for example, whether the occupant belongs to the animate
        class, inanimate class, human class, or non-human class.  Furthermore, as
        used herein, \"attributes of an\noccupant\" further defines the class of the
        occupant, for example, whether the occupant belonging to the animate class
        is an adult human, a child, a non-human animal, the number of such occupants
        and any other attribute of the occupant that may need to be\ndetermined.  Further,
        as used herein an \"occupant\" refers to an animate or an inanimate object
        in an occupancy space.  For example, an occupant may be a person, an animal,
        or a piece of furniture or equipment in the occupancy space.\n<BR><BR> Occupancy
        of each of the occupancy zones are detected 101.  The occupancy of the occupancy
        zones is detected to determine presence of an occupant in the occupancy space.
        \ The detected occupancy of each of the occupancy zones at any given time
        is\nstored 102 in an occupancy database.  The detected occupancy of each of
        the occupancy zones stored in the occupancy database is used as historical
        data for correlating and determining 103 patterns of occupancy in each of
        the occupancy zones over a\npredetermined duration, for example, over a day
        or a week.  The patterns of occupancy are generally consistent with the living
        patterns of the occupants.  Future occupancy of the occupancy zones is predicted
        104 based on the determined patterns of\noccupancy of each of the occupancy
        zones.  The environmental conditions of the occupancy zones in the occupancy
        space are controlled 105 based on one or more of the detected occupancy and
        the predicted future occupancy of the occupancy zones.\n<BR><BR> Environmental
        conditions of each of the occupancy zones are also detected.  The environmental
        conditions close to the occupant may be detected as the occupant moves within
        the occupancy zones of the occupancy space.  The environmental conditions\nof
        the occupancy zones, for example, comprise temperature, humidity, etc. The
        detected environmental conditions are correlated with preferred environmental
        conditions of the occupant.  The preferred environmental conditions, for example,
        comprise\npredefined comfort levels of the occupant.  Environmental conditions
        outside of the occupancy space may also be detected.  The external environmental
        conditions comprise, for example, air temperature, wind speed, solar radiation,
        etc. The external\nenvironmental conditions may also be predicted using weather
        forecasts.\n<BR><BR> Future occupancy of the occupancy zones is predicted
        based on the historical patterns of detected occupancy stored in the occupancy
        database.  The future occupancy is predicted by correlation with the records
        in the occupancy database and\npredictive control is exercised by a set of
        predefined rules.  The set of predefined rules is herein also referred to
        as a predictive control algorithm.  The predictive control algorithm computes
        future occupancy based on the detected occupancy over a\npredetermined duration.\n<BR><BR>
        Detecting the immediate occupancy in the occupancy zones and then conditioning
        the occupancy zones to an optimal level requires time and causes discomfort
        to the occupants while the occupancy zones are being conditioned to the optimal
        level. \nThe predictive control algorithm predicts the occupancy patterns
        and proactively conditions the occupancy zones to set points or optimal levels,
        prior to occupancy of the occupancy zones.\n<BR><BR> Consider for example,
        an occupant Jane who wakes up in the morning at 6 a.m.  and goes into the
        kitchen at 7 a.m.  to prepare breakfast at her residence.  Jane leaves the
        house at 7.30 a.m.  after breakfast.  At night the kitchen is not\nconditioned
        since Jane only occupies a bedroom.  If Jane's presence is detected in the
        kitchen, when she prepares breakfast at 7 a.m., and then the system starts
        conditioning the kitchen, the kitchen temperature would be suboptimal while
        Jane cooks and\neats.  The kitchen would reach the optimal level by around
        7.30 a.m.  at which time Jane would be ready to leave the house.  If however,
        the kitchen is proactively conditioned at 6.30 a.m.  based on the predictive
        control algorithm, Jane would occupy a\nkitchen which is already at the set
        point or optimal level.\n<BR><BR> Conditioning of occupancy zones based on
        occupancy saves energy by not conditioning the unoccupied occupancy zones.
        \ The predictive control algorithm predicts which of the occupancy zones is
        likely to be occupied and conditions the occupancy\nzones proactively.  Predictive
        conditioning therefore prevents any discomfort to the occupant.  Even though
        different occupancy zones in the occupancy space are not conditioned, the
        occupants always enter the occupancy zones that are predictively\nconditioned
        in anticipation.\n<BR><BR> In an embodiment, random short term occupancies
        over a predetermined duration, for example, over a day can be averaged out
        by averaging or normalizing the occupancy patterns over several days.  This
        eliminates subsequent or daily predictive\nconditioning of occupancy zones
        that are seldom visited or visited once or twice a week.  In another embodiment,
        the occupancy patterns are averaged over one or more weeks.  This enables
        the living patterns of the occupants to be distinguished on\nweekdays compared
        to weekends.  Normalizing the occupancy patterns over several predetermined
        durations enables a robust predictive control, which is consistent with the
        living patterns of the occupants over a day or a week.\n<BR><BR> In an embodiment,
        the class and attributes of an occupant in each of the occupancy zones in
        the occupancy space are determined for determining the control of the environmental
        conditions in the occupancy zones.  Consider an example of an\noccupant detected
        in one of the occupancy zones.  The class and attributes of the occupant are
        determined to determine whether the occupant is a human or a non-human occupant.
        \ If the occupant is non-human, the environmental conditions of the occupancy\nzones
        may be minimal or not controlled.  If the occupant is human, the environmental
        conditions of the occupancy zones may be controlled.  To determine the class
        and attributes of the occupant, an infrared (IR) image of the occupant in
        each of the\noccupancy zones in the occupancy space is captured.  Infrared
        image information of the captured image is digitized to obtain a thermal signature
        of the occupant, the details of which are disclosed in the co-pending application
        Ser.  No. 12/274,344, which\nis incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
        \ As used herein, \"thermal signature\" refers to the digitized version of
        the infrared emission pattern of an occupant in an occupancy space when the
        occupant is infrared imaged using, for example,\ninfrared sensors.  The thermal
        signature of the occupant is compared with thermal signatures of multiple
        occupants stored in a thermal signature database for determining the class
        and the attributes of the occupant.\n<BR><BR> The environmental conditions
        of the occupancy zones are predictively controlled based on one or more of
        the detected occupancy and environmental conditions of the occupancy space,
        the predicted future occupancy, the determined class and\nattributes of the
        occupant, and the present and forecast, internal and external environmental
        conditions.  For example, the weather forecast data can also be incorporated
        to derive optimal conditioning levels.  The system disclosed herein can access\nweather
        forecasts for the next few days and use that information to regulate the environmental
        conditions in the occupancy zones not just on a diurnal basis but also on
        a longer weekly pattern.  For example, if the forecast suggests that the temperature\nis
        going to drop in the night to a temperature lower than average, the system
        adjusts the set point temperature to a higher value in few of the rooms.  This
        would offset the greater heat loss during the night making the occupancy space
        more comfortable.\n<BR><BR> The environmental conditions in the occupancy
        zones are also controlled based on the predefined comfort levels of the occupant.
        \ The environmental conditions are controlled prior to the occupancy of the
        occupancy zones by the occupant based on\nthe predicted future occupancy.
        \ In an embodiment, the environmental conditions of the occupancy zones are
        manually controlled using a graphical user interface (GUI) located either
        proximally or remotely with respect to the occupancy zones.  For example,\nthe
        GUI for controlling one of the occupancy zones may be located within the occupancy
        zone for enabling the occupant to control the environmental conditions.  Alternatively,
        the GUI may be located within a control room outside the occupancy zone,\nthereby
        enabling a console operator to control the environmental conditions.\n<BR><BR>
        In another embodiment, the environmental conditions of the remotely located
        occupancy zones are controlled using a wireless device.  The environmental
        conditions are controlled by issuing control instructions.  The issued control
        instructions\nare executed by multiple actuators provided in each of the occupancy
        zones.  The environmental conditions are also controlled by controlling air
        flow using multiple vents in the occupancy zones.  The environmental conditions
        of areas proximal to the\noccupant are controlled for providing an optimum
        comfort level.\n<BR><BR> Energy consumption is reduced by controlling the
        environmental conditions of only the areas proximal to the occupant and not
        controlling areas remote to the occupant.  Furthermore, environmental conditions
        other than the temperature in the\noccupancy zones are also controlled, thereby
        providing the occupant with comfortable environmental conditions while reducing
        the change in temperature required to achieve the set point level.  The reduction
        in the change in temperature reduces total\nenergy consumed.  Energy is also
        saved by accounting for external environmental conditions and proactively
        controlling the internal environmental conditions.\n<BR><BR> To illustrate
        the reduction in energy consumption, consider the following example.  The
        energy needed to heat or cool an occupancy space is dependent on the temperature
        difference between the inside of the occupancy space and the outside.  If\nthe
        outside temperature is 40.degree.  F. and the inside temperature is set to
        72.degree.  F., then the occupancy space needs to be heated by 32.degree.
        \ F. If the difference of 32.degree.  F. is to be maintained for one day,
        the total heating may be\nreferred to as 32 heating degree days.\n<BR><BR>
        Consider, for example, a family living in a house having four occupancy zones.
        \ The occupancy zones comprise two bedrooms, a kitchen, and a living room.
        \ The family uses the kitchen and the living room in the evening and then
        retires to the\nbedrooms at night.  In the evening, the kitchen and living
        room is heated to 72.degree.  F. while they are occupied and the bedrooms
        are cooled to around 62.degree.  F. When the family retires to the bedrooms,
        the bedrooms are heated to 72.degree.  F.\nand the kitchen and living room
        are allowed to cool to 62.degree.  F. In this example, the average temperature
        of the house is given by: [(number of occupancy zones at 72 F*2)+(number of
        occupancy zones at 62 F*2)]/total number of occupancy zones in the\nhouse
        =[(2*72)+(2*62)]/4=68.degree.  F.\n<BR><BR> If the average occupancy space
        temperature were 68.degree.  F. instead of 72.degree.  F., then the occupancy
        space needs to be heated by just 28.degree.  F. Hence, the occupancy space
        will be supplied less heat.  The actual gain may be computed\nusing the calculation
        32-28/32*100=12.5%.  Hence, in this case, by lowering the temperature by just
        4.degree.  F., the efficiency of heating is increased by 12.5%, which results
        in a fairly significant cut in energy bills.  There is no change in the\ncomfort
        level of the occupants since the occupancy zones occupied by them are set
        to the optimal level of 72.degree.  F.\n<BR><BR> The actual relationships
        between temperature differences and heat loads may be more complex than illustrated
        above.  However, even higher efficiency gains are computed using the complex
        actual relationships.  The simplified relationship\nillustrated above serves
        as a fairly accurate first order approximation of the efficiency gain.  The
        gain may also vary with location, climate, and the actual average occupancy
        space temperature.  The example furnished above is typical of a temperate\nclimatic
        region in North America in winter.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 2 illustrates a system 200
        for predictively controlling environmental conditions of multiple occupancy
        zones in an occupancy space.  The system 200 disclosed herein comprises multiple
        distributed occupancy sensors 201, multiple distributed\nenvironmental sensors
        202, an occupancy pattern determination module 204, a prediction module 206,
        a graphical user interface (GUI) 209, a control module 205, an occupancy database
        203, multiple vents 207, and multiple actuators 208.  The occupancy\nsensors
        201 and the environmental sensors 202 are, for example, deployed within the
        occupancy space as distributed sensor nodes or \"motes\" in a network of sensors.\n<BR><BR>
        The occupancy sensors 201 detect occupancy of each of the occupancy zones.
        \ The environmental sensors 202 detect the environmental conditions of the
        occupancy zones in the occupancy space.  The environmental sensors 202 may
        also detect\nenvironmental conditions outside the occupancy space.  To detect
        the environmental conditions outside the occupancy space, one or more environmental
        sensors 202 may be positioned outside the occupancy space.  The external environmental
        conditions\ncomprise, for example, air temperature, wind speed, solar radiation,
        etc. The external environmental conditions are also predicted using weather
        forecasts.  The occupancy database 203 stores the detected occupancy of each
        of the occupancy zones as\nhistorical data.  The occupancy sensors 201 and
        the environmental sensors 202 are, for example, battery operated and communicate
        wirelessly with the control module 205.\n<BR><BR> The occupancy sensors 201
        are based on one or more of charged coupled device (CCD) sensors and complimentary
        metal oxide semiconductor sensors that detect occupancy using specific infrared
        signatures and digital image processing techniques.  The\noccupancy sensors
        201 comprise a class and attribute determination module 201a.  The class and
        attribute determination module 201a determines class and attributes of an
        occupant in each of the occupancy zones in the occupancy space for enabling
        the\ncontrol module 205 to determine the control of the environmental conditions
        of the occupancy zones.  The class and attribute determination module 201a
        comprises an image capture device 201b, an image digitization module 201c,
        and a comparison module\n201d.  The image capture device 201b captures an
        infrared image of the occupant in each of the occupancy zones in the occupancy
        space.  The image capture device 201b uses, for example, charge coupled devices
        (CCDs), complimentary metal oxide\nsemiconductor (CMOS) sensors, microbolometers
        or pyroelectric devices for capturing the image.  The image digitization module
        201c digitizes infrared image information of the captured image to obtain
        a thermal signature of the occupant.  The comparison\nmodule 201d compares
        the thermal signature of the occupant with thermal signatures of multiple
        occupants stored in a thermal signature database 210 for determining the class
        and the attributes of the occupant.\n<BR><BR> The occupancy pattern determination
        module 204 determines patterns of occupancy of each of the occupancy zones
        over a predetermined duration using the historical data stored in the occupancy
        database 203.  The prediction module 206 predicts\nfuture occupancy of the
        occupancy zones based on the determined patterns of occupancy of each of the
        occupancy zones, as disclosed in the detailed description of FIG. 1.  The
        control module 205 predictively controls the environmental conditions of the\noccupancy
        zones in the occupancy space based on one or more of the detected occupancy,
        the predicted future occupancy, the determined class and attributes of the
        occupant, and the detected internal and external environmental conditions.
        \ Control\nparameters, for example, a demand response signal and different
        energy tier rates from the utilities can be combined with the occupancy patterns
        to make optimal conditioning decisions.\n<BR><BR> The control module 205 issues
        control instructions executed by the actuators 208.  The actuators 208 are
        used to control a device such as a furnace or an air conditioner.  The actuators
        208 are also, for example, used to control individual\nheaters, radiators,
        split/window air conditioning units, etc. The vents 207 are mechanical devices
        with actuators 208 for controlling air flow in each of the occupancy zones
        through the vents 207.  The vents 207 are, for example, modular drop-in vents\nthat
        help control the environmental conditions of the occupancy zones by controlling
        air flow.  The vents 207 enable granular control of the environmental conditions
        of each of the occupancy zones.  The vents 207 and the actuators 208 may be
        battery\noperated and may communicate wirelessly with the control module 205.
        \ The control module 205 predictively controls the vents 207 through the actuators
        208.  The vents 207 and the actuators 208 may utilize forced air heating and
        cooling techniques.  For\nexample, in case of a central forced air system,
        the actuator 208 controls a central system, for example, the furnace or the
        air conditioning units, while the vents 207 redirect and control the flow
        of air into the occupancy zones.  Air may be forced\nover heating or cooling
        coils and then distributed throughout the occupancy zones via a duct system
        (not shown).  The heating or cooling coils may be heated or cooled hydronically
        or by using a heat exchanger, a fuel burner, or electricity.\n<BR><BR> The
        GUI 209 enables controlling of the environmental conditions of the occupancy
        zones in either a proximal location or a remote location.  The GUI 209 provides
        one or more configurable and selectable modes of operation, for example, an
        economy\nmode and a comfort mode for the control module 205.  The GUI 209
        displays the controlled environmental conditions.  The GUI 209 comprises,
        for example, a touch screen based interface for providing a user, for example,
        the occupant or a console operator,\neasy control of the environmental conditions
        of the occupancy zones.  The GUI 209 may also be a web based interface or
        an application running on smart phones and pen-enabled computer tablets (tablet
        PCs).  A user may control the environmental conditions\nof the occupancy space
        using the web based GUI 209 over a network, for example, the internet.  The
        GUI 209 displaying temperature heat maps and occupancy maps overlaid on a
        floor plan of an occupancy space is exemplarily illustrated in FIG. 10.  A
        GUI\n209 displaying temperatures of occupancy zones and setup options available
        to a user is exemplarily illustrated in FIG. 11.  The system 200 disclosed
        herein may be retrofitted into an existing occupancy space, for example, a
        residential or commercial\nbuilding.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 3 exemplarily illustrates
        the architecture of a computer system 300 used for predictively controlling
        environmental conditions of multiple occupancy zones in an occupancy space.
        \ The control module 205, the occupancy database 203, the\noccupancy pattern
        determination module 204, the prediction module 206, and the GUI 209 are typically
        installed on a portable, mobile or stationary computing device, which employs
        the architecture of the computer system 300 exemplarily illustrated in FIG.\n3.
        \ In an embodiment, the computer system 300 may employ an alternative architecture,
        for example, the computer system 300 may employ a dedicated or specialized
        processor or microcontroller, in lieu of a conventional processor 301, configured
        for\ncontrolling environmental conditions in an occupancy space.\n<BR><BR>
        The control module 205, the occupancy sensors 201, and the environmental sensors
        202 communicate with each other via a network.  The network is, for example,
        a wireless network, a wired network, a local area network (LAN), etc. The
        computer\nsystem 300 comprises, for example, a processor 301, a memory unit
        302 for storing programs and data, an input/output (I/O) controller 303, a
        network interface 304, a network bus 305, a display unit 306, input devices
        307, a fixed media drive 308, a\nremovable media drive 309, and output devices
        310, for example, a printer, etc.\n<BR><BR> The processor 301 is an electronic
        circuit that can execute computer programs.  The memory unit 302 is used for
        storing programs, applications, and data.  For example, the control module
        205 is stored on the memory unit 302 of the computer\nsystem 300.  The memory
        unit 302 is, for example, a random access memory (RAM) or another type of
        dynamic storage device that stores information and instructions for execution
        by the processor 301.  The memory unit 302 also stores temporary variables
        and\nother intermediate information used during execution of the instructions
        by the processor 301.  The computer system 300 further comprises a read only
        memory (ROM) or another type of static storage device that stores static information
        and instructions\nfor the processor 301.  The network interface 304 enables
        connection of the computer system 300 to the network.  The I/O controller
        303 controls the input and output actions performed by the user.  The network
        bus 305 permits communication between the\nmodules, for example, 201c, 201d,
        203, 204, 205, 206, and 209 of the system 200 disclosed herein.\n<BR><BR>
        The display unit 306 displays results of the control module 205 to the user.
        \ The input devices 307 are used for inputting data into the computer system
        300.  The input devices 307 are, for example, a keyboard such as an alphanumeric
        keyboard, a\njoystick, a mouse, a touch pad, a light pen, etc. The computer
        system 300 further comprises a fixed media drive 308 and a removable media
        drive 309 for receiving removable media.\n<BR><BR> Computer applications and
        programs are used for operating the computer system 300.  The programs are
        loaded onto the fixed media drive 308 and into the memory unit 302 of the
        computer system 300 via the removable media drive 309.  In an\nembodiment,
        the computer applications and programs may be loaded directly through the
        network.  Computer applications and programs are executed by double clicking
        a related icon displayed on the display unit 306 using one of the input devices
        307.  The\nuser interacts with the computer system 300 using the GUI 209 of
        the display unit 306.\n<BR><BR> The computer system 300 employs operating
        systems for performing multiple tasks.  An operating system is responsible
        for the management and coordination of activities and the sharing of the resources
        of the computer system 300.  The operating\nsystem further manages security
        of the computer system 300, peripheral devices connected to the computer system
        300, and network connections.  The operating system employed on the computer
        system 300 recognizes, for example, inputs provided by the user\nusing one
        of the input devices 307, the output display, files and directories stored
        locally on the fixed media drive 308, etc. The operating system on the computer
        system 300 executes different programs initiated by the user using the processor
        301. \nInstructions for executing the control module 205 functions are retrieved
        by the processor 301 from the program memory in the form of signals.  Location
        of the instructions in the program memory is determined by a program counter
        (PC).  The program\ncounter stores a number that identifies the current position
        in the program of the control module 205.\n<BR><BR> The instructions fetched
        by the processor 301 from the program memory after being processed are decoded.
        \ After processing and decoding, the processor 301 executes the instructions.
        \ For example, the occupancy pattern determination module 204\ndefines instructions
        for determining patterns of occupancy of each of the occupancy zones over
        a predetermined duration.  The prediction module 206 defines instructions
        for predicting future occupancy of the occupancy zones based on the determined\npatterns
        of occupancy of each of the occupancy zones.  The image digitization module
        201c defines instructions for digitizing infrared image information of an
        infrared image of the occupant captured by the image capture device 201b to
        obtain a thermal\nsignature of the occupant.  The comparison module 201d defines
        instructions for comparing the thermal signature of the occupant with thermal
        signatures of multiple occupants stored in the thermal signature database
        210 for determining the class and\nattributes of the occupant.  The control
        module 205 defines instructions for predictively controlling the environmental
        conditions of the occupancy zones based on one or more of the detected occupancy
        and the predicted future occupancy, the determined\nclass and attributes of
        the occupant, the internal and external environmental conditions, etc. which
        are stored in the program memory or received from a remote server.\n<BR><BR>
        The processor 301 retrieves the instructions defined by the occupancy pattern
        determination module 204, the prediction module 206, the control module 205,
        the image digitization module 201c, and the comparison module 201d, and executes
        the\ninstructions.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 4 exemplarily illustrates deployment of
        the components of the system 200 for predictively controlling environmental
        conditions of multiple occupancy zones 401.  The components assist and enable
        control of the environmental conditions of the\noccupancy zones 401.  The
        components comprise, for example, a furnace 402, the vents 207, the actuators
        208, the occupancy sensors 201, and the environmental sensors 202.  The occupancy
        sensors 201 and environmental sensors 202 in the occupancy zones 401\ndetect
        occupancy and environmental conditions of the occupancy zones 401 respectively.\n<BR><BR>
        The control module 205 modifies the environmental conditions to suit the comfort
        levels of the occupant.  The control module 205 issues control instructions
        to the vents 207 and the actuators 208.  The actuators 208 execute the control
        of the\nfurnace 402.  The actuators 208 also execute control of the air conditioner
        and the individual heaters.  The vents 207 regulate airflow in the occupancy
        zones 401.  The control instructions issued by the control module 205 carry
        information regarding\nenvironmental conditions of the occupied occupancy
        zones 401 and the occupancy zones 401 whose occupancy is predicted.  The control
        instructions control the environmental conditions of only those occupancy
        zones 401 occupied by human occupants and the\noccupancy zones 401 predicted
        to be occupied, thereby minimizing energy consumption by avoiding conditioning
        of unoccupied spaces.\n<BR><BR> Consider, for example, an occupancy space
        as illustrated in FIG. 4.  Different occupancy zones 401, for example, different
        rooms of the occupancy space, for example, a house, may be occupied by multiple
        occupants.  The occupancy sensors 201\ndetect the presence of the occupants
        in the occupancy zones 401.  The environmental sensors 202 detect the environmental
        conditions of the occupancy zones 401.  The control module 205 receives the
        detected occupancy information from the occupancy sensors\n201 and detected
        environmental conditions information from the environmental sensors 202.  The
        control module 205 processes the received occupancy information and the received
        environmental conditions information.  The control module 205 determines the\ndifference
        between the detected environmental conditions and optimum environmental conditions
        preferred by the occupants.  Further, the control module 205 issues control
        instructions to the actuators 208 to control the environmental conditions
        of the\noccupancy zones 401.  The actuators 208 execute the control instructions
        and regulate air flow in and out of the vents 207.\n<BR><BR> The furnace 402
        is used to provide heat to the occupancy zones 401.  Flow of heat into the
        occupancy zones 401 is illustrated using block arrows in FIG. 4.  The occupancy
        information from the occupancy sensors 201 and environmental conditions\ninformation
        from the environmental sensors 202 are used to predict future occupancy of
        the occupancy zones 401 and control the environmental conditions of the occupancy
        zones 401.\n<BR><BR> FIGS. 5A-5C exemplarily illustrate a flowchart comprising
        the steps of predictively controlling environmental conditions in multiple
        occupancy zones 401 in an occupancy space.  The system 200 disclosed herein
        applies a predictive control\nalgorithm 502 for predictively controlling environmental
        conditions in occupancy zones 401 of an occupancy space.  The predictive control
        algorithm 502 accepts different inputs 501 for consideration, for example,
        outside temperature (OT), room\ntemperature (RTEMPn), room occupancy (ROCCn),
        room set temperature (RSETTEMPn), home upper temperature (HUTemp) setting,
        home lower temperature (HLTemp) setting, a heating, ventilating and air conditioning
        mode (HVACMode), vacation status (VStatus),\nvacation threshold settings (VHUTemp
        and VLUTemp), back pressure (BP) data, a demand response (DR) signal and energy
        price tier from the utilities, etc. to make control decisions about opening
        or closing the vents 207 or actuating the furnace 402 or air\nconditioning
        unit.  FIG. 5D exemplarily illustrates application of the predictive control
        algorithm 502 using the inputs 501 for controlling the actuators 208 and vents
        207.  The demand response signal from the utilities is obtained, for example,
        via the\ninternet.  As illustrated in FIG. 5A, the predictive control algorithm
        502 determines 503 whether the heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC)
        mode is set to operate in a heating mode 505 or a cooling mode 504.\n<BR><BR>
        In the heating mode 505 as illustrated in FIG. 5B, the predictive control
        algorithm 502 checks 506 whether the vacation mode, identified by the parameter
        VStatus, is enabled or disabled.  If the vacation mode is enabled, the predictive
        control\nalgorithm 502 checks whether the measured temperatures HUTemp and
        HLTemp of the occupancy zones 401 of a building space are within the user
        defined vacation threshold settings VHUTemp and VLUTemp 508 respectively.
        \ If the measured temperatures HUTemp and\nHLTemp of the occupancy zones 401
        of the building space are within the user defined vacation threshold settings
        VHUTemp and VLUTemp, the system 200 does not condition the building space.
        \ The system 200 simultaneously identifies additional vents 207 that\ncan
        be closed during the next time cycle.\n<BR><BR> In the heating mode 505, if
        the vacation mode is disabled, the predictive control algorithm 502 checks
        and compares 507 the measured room temperatures (RTEMPn) from each occupancy
        zone 401 against the occupancy zone's user defined set\ntemperature (RSETTEMPn).
        \ This process identifies all the occupancy zones 401 that require additional
        heat.  If RTEMP is less than RSETTEMPn, the predictive control algorithm 502
        then identifies 510 the occupancy status (ROCCn) of the occupancy zones 401\nthat
        are requesting for additional heat.  When the predictive control algorithm
        502 identifies that all occupied zones are requesting for additional heat,
        the control module 205 sends control signals and instructions for turning
        on the furnace 402 and\nopening the vents 207 in the occupied zones.  If the
        occupancy status shows that the occupancy zones 401 are unoccupied, the predictive
        control algorithm 502 then determines 512 whether the occupancy zones 401
        are likely to be occupied during the next\ntime cycle.  If the occupancy zones
        401 will be occupied during the next time cycle, the control module 205 sends
        control signals and instructions to open the vents 207.  When none of the
        occupancy zones 401 require conditioning in the current cycle, the\npredictive
        control algorithm 502 checks the back pressure (BP) thresholds to determine
        the occupancy zones 401 where the vents 207 can be safely closed without compromising
        system performance.  If the occupancy zones 401 will not be occupied during
        the\nnext time cycle, the predictive control algorithm 502 compares 513 the
        back pressure with the maximum back pressure allowed.\n<BR><BR> If the back
        pressure is not greater than the maximum back pressure allowed, the control
        module 205 sends control signals and instructions to close the vents 207.
        \ If the back pressure is greater than the maximum back pressure allowed,
        the\npredictive control algorithm 502 determines 514 whether any of the occupancy
        zones 401 are pending conditioning.  If any of the occupancy zones 401 are
        pending conditioning, the operation is suspended.  If none of the occupancy
        zones 401 are pending\nconditioning, the control module 205 sends control
        signals and instructions to shut down the furnace 402.\n<BR><BR> In the heating
        mode 505, if the vacation mode is disabled and if RTEMP is not less than RSETTEMPn,
        the predictive control algorithm 502 determines 509 whether the back pressure
        is greater than the maximum back pressure allowed.  If the back\npressure
        is not greater than the maximum back pressure allowed, the control module
        205 sends control signals and instructions to close the vents 207.  If the
        back pressure is greater than the maximum back pressure allowed, the predictive
        control\nalgorithm 502 determines 511 whether any of the occupancy zones 401
        are pending conditioning.  If any of the occupancy zones 401 are pending conditioning,
        the operation is suspended.  If none of the occupancy zones 401 are pending
        conditioning, the\ncontrol module 205 sends control signals and instructions
        to shut down the furnace 402.\n<BR><BR> In the cooling mode 504 as illustrated
        in FIG. 5C, the predictive control algorithm 502 checks whether the vacation
        mode, identified by the parameter VStatus, is enabled or disabled 515.  If
        the vacation mode is enabled, the predictive control\nalgorithm 502 checks
        whether the measured temperatures HUTemp and HLTemp of the occupancy zones
        401 of the building space, are within the user defined vacation threshold
        settings VHUTemp and VLUTemp 517 respectively.  If the measured temperatures
        HUTemp\nand HLTemp of the occupancy zones 401 of the building space are within
        the user defined vacation threshold settings VHUTemp and VLUTemp, the system
        200 does not condition the building space.  The system 200 simultaneously
        identifies additional vents 207\nthat can be closed during the next time cycle.\n<BR><BR>
        In the cooling mode 504, if the vacation mode is disabled, the predictive
        control algorithm 502 checks and compares 516 the measured room temperatures
        (RTEMPn) from each occupancy zone 401 against the room's user defined set
        temperature\n(RSETTEMPn).  This process identifies all the occupancy zones
        401 that require additional cold air.  If RTEMP is greater than RSETTEMPn,
        the predictive control algorithm 502 then identifies 519 the occupancy status
        (ROCCn) of the occupancy zones 401 that\nare requesting for additional cold
        air.  When the predictive control algorithm 502 identifies all occupied zones
        requesting for additional cold air, the control module 205 sends control signals
        and instructions for turning on the air conditioning (AC)\nunit and opening
        the vents 207 in the occupied zones.\n<BR><BR> If the occupancy status shows
        that the occupancy zones 401 are unoccupied and do not require additional
        conditioning, the predictive control algorithm 502 then determines 521 whether
        the occupancy zones 401 are likely to be occupied during the\nnext time cycle.
        \ If the occupancy zones 401 will be occupied during the next time cycle,
        the control module 205 sends control signals and instructions to open the
        vents 207.  When none of the occupancy zones 401 require conditioning in the
        current\ncycle, the predictive control algorithm 502 looks for the occupancy
        zones 401 with the lowest probability of occupancy and checks the back pressure
        (BP) thresholds to determine the occupancy zones 401 where the vents 207 can
        be safely closed without\ncompromising system performance.  If the occupancy
        zones 401 will not be occupied during the next time cycle, the predictive
        control algorithm 502 compares 522 the back pressure with the maximum back
        pressure allowed.  If the back pressure is not greater\nthan the maximum back
        pressure allowed, the control module 205 sends control signals and instructions
        to close the vents 207.  If the back pressure is greater than the maximum
        back pressure allowed, the predictive control algorithm 502 determines 523\nwhether
        any of the occupancy zones 401 are pending conditioning.  If any of the occupancy
        zones 401 are pending conditioning, the operation is suspended.  If none of
        the occupancy zones 401 are pending conditioning, the control module 205 sends
        control\nsignals and instructions to shut down the air conditioning unit.\n<BR><BR>
        If RTEMP is not greater than RSETTEMPn, the predictive control algorithm 502
        determines 518 whether the back pressure is greater than the maximum back
        pressure allowed.  If the back pressure is not greater than the maximum back
        pressure allowed,\nthe control module 205 sends control signals and instructions
        to close the vents 207.  If the back pressure is greater than the maximum
        back pressure allowed, the predictive control algorithm 502 determines 520
        whether any of the occupancy zones 401 are\npending conditioning.  If any
        of the occupancy zones 401 are pending conditioning, the operation is suspended.
        \ If none of the occupancy zones 401 are pending conditioning, the control
        module 205 sends control signals and instructions to shut down the\nair conditioning
        unit.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 6 exemplarily illustrates a flowchart comprising the
        steps of predictively controlling environmental conditions in occupancy zones
        401 based on a combination of control parameters, for example, the demand
        response signal from utilities,\ndetected environmental external and internal
        conditions, predicted occupancy, etc. The predictive control algorithm 502
        accepts the demand response signal 601 from the utilities.  The predictive
        control algorithm 502 further collects temperature data 602\nfrom the occupancy
        zones 401 in the building and the weather forecast.  The system 200 predicts
        603 the occupancy and the conditioning needs of the occupancy zones 401 based
        on the detected occupancy stored in the occupancy database 203.  The predictive\ncontrol
        algorithm 502 combines the demand response signal with the predicted occupancy
        patterns, conditioning needs, and temperature data from the occupancy zones
        401 within the building and the weather forecast to make intelligent control
        decisions. \nThe system 200 controls 604 the HVAC and the vents 207 to control
        the environmental conditions of the occupancy zones 401 based on the detected
        and predicted future occupancy.  The unoccupied zones are over-conditioned
        and the air is used as thermal\nstorage mass.  The fan-only mode of HVAC is
        utilized to circulate the cold air in the unoccupied zones as the day progresses.
        \ For example, on a hot summer day, a demand response signal enables the pre-cooling
        of the building space in the early morning\nhours during which the electricity
        price tier is lower and also the efficiency to condition the building is higher.
        \ The occupancy zones 401 that are not likely to be occupied during the day
        can be over-cooled and the cold air can be circulated through\nthe building
        throughout the remainder of the demand response period.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 7 exemplarily
        illustrates a flowchart comprising the steps of predictively controlling environmental
        conditions in occupancy zones 401 based on a combination of control parameters,
        for example, the information on a utility tier rate\nstructure, detected environmental
        external and internal conditions, predicted occupancy, etc. Several progressive
        utilities already employ tiered rate structure for energy.  The predictive
        control algorithm 502 accepts the utility tier rate structure\ninformation
        701, for example, via internet.  The predictive control algorithm 502 further
        collects temperature data 602 from the occupancy zones 401 in the building
        and the weather forecast.  The system 200 predicts 603 the occupancy and the
        conditioning\nneeds of the occupancy zones 401 based on the detected occupancy
        stored in the occupancy database 203.\n<BR><BR> The predictive control algorithm
        502 combines the rate information with the predicted occupancy, the conditioning
        needs, and the historical and future temperature data from the occupancy zones
        401 for making optimal conditioning decisions while\nleveraging lower energy
        price.  The system 200 controls 702 the HVAC and the vents 207 to control
        the environmental conditions of the occupancy zones 401 based on the detected
        and predicted future occupancy to maximize the HVAC operation during low tier\nrates.\n<BR><BR>
        FIG. 8 exemplarily illustrates a graphical user interface (GUI) 209 for selecting
        different configurable modes for predictively controlling environment conditions
        in the occupancy zones 401.  A slider component 801 is provided on the GUI
        209 for\nenabling a user to select different configurable modes, for example,
        a comfort mode and an economy mode.  The comfort mode controls the environmental
        conditions in all occupancy zones irrespective of the occupancy, while the
        economy mode conditions the\noccupancy zones based on the predicted future
        occupancy.  The selection of the comfort mode and the economy mode controls
        the effectiveness of the predictive control algorithm 502 and hence the number
        of occupancy zones 401 that are conditioned in\nadvance.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 9
        exemplarily illustrates a flowchart comprising the steps of predictively controlling
        environmental conditions in occupancy zones 401 in different configurable
        modes of HVAC operation, for example, the comfort mode and the economy mode.
        \nThe user can select 901 the degree of comfort and efficiency using the slider
        component 801 on the GUI 209 as exemplarily illustrated in FIG. 8.  The predictive
        control algorithm 502 collects 902 temperature and occupancy data from the
        occupancy zones\n401 in a building.  The system 200 predicts 603 the occupancy
        and the conditioning needs of the occupancy zones 401 based on the detected
        occupancy stored in the occupancy database 203.  The predictive control algorithm
        502 accepts the user settings from\nthe GUI 209 and combines the user settings
        with the predicted occupancy patterns, conditioning needs, and detected occupancy
        and temperature data from the occupancy zones 401 within the building to make
        intelligent control decisions.  The system 200\ncontrols 903 the HVAC and
        the vents 207 to control the environmental conditions of the occupancy zones
        401 based on the user settings.  For example, if the system 200 is set to
        operate in the economy mode, the system 200 conditions only the occupancy\nzones
        401 with a high probability of occupancy.  In this case more occupancy zones
        401 will be left unconditioned or minimally conditioned leading to greater
        savings.  In the comfort mode, the system 200 maintains the building temperature
        within the\npredefined temperature set point by controlling temperature in
        all the occupancy zones 401, even if the probability of future occupancy is
        small.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 10 exemplarily illustrates a GUI 209 displaying heat
        maps and occupancy maps of one or more occupancy zones 401 in an occupancy
        space.  The GUI 209 displays controlled environmental conditions by overlaying
        temperature heat maps and\noccupancy maps on a floor plan of the occupancy
        space.  The heat maps display temperatures of the occupancy zones 401 by mapping
        the temperatures using a coordinate system.  The GUI 209 may display present
        temperatures and offset temperatures of the\noccupancy zones 401, as exemplarily
        illustrated in FIG. 11.  The occupancy maps display the environmental conditions
        and number of instant occupants in each of the occupancy zones 401 of the
        occupancy space.  The environmental conditions displayed on the\nGUI 209 comprise,
        for example, current temperature, set temperature, etc. The GUI 209 may also
        provide a status panel displaying date, time, mode, and iteration.\n<BR><BR>
        FIG. 11 exemplarily illustrates a GUI 209 displaying temperatures of occupancy
        zones 401 and setup options.  The GUI 209 also provides setup options to enable
        control of the environmental conditions to be configured to suit the comfort
        levels of\nthe occupant for different environmental conditions.  The GUI 209
        further provides an advanced setup option for the occupant to manually configure
        the environmental conditions of each of the occupancy zones 401.  The advanced
        setup comprises, for\nexample, an option for layout plotting of temperatures.
        \ The advanced setup further provides an option for displaying the occupancy
        zones 401 on a layout for easy configuration.  The GUI 209 further enables
        the occupant to choose between one or more\nconfigurable and selectable modes
        of operation, for example, an economy mode and a comfort mode of the system
        200 depending on the comfort level and energy savings the occupant wishes
        to achieve.  The GUI 209 further provides an option to choose between\nautomatic
        configuration and manual configuration to attain the preferred comfort levels
        in each of the occupancy zones 401.  The GUI 209 also displays a real time
        graph representing energy saved by the system 200 disclosed herein.\n<BR><BR>
        Consider an example of a house with John and Jane living with their pet dog
        Spot in their house.  In this example, the house is the occupancy space, the
        bedroom, the living room, the kitchen, and the basement are the occupancy
        zones 401, and\nJohn, Jane, and Spot are the animate occupants of the occupancy
        zones 401.  The living patterns of John, Jane, and Spot are as follows: John
        leaves for work at 8 a.m.  and returns home at 5 p.m.  everyday.  Jane leaves
        home for work at 9 a.m.  and\nreturns home at 6 p.m.  everyday.  John washes
        the dishes in the kitchen before Jane arrives.  Jane cooks dinner at 7 p.m.
        \ John and Jane then watch television (TV) till they go to bed at 10 p.m.
        \ Spot stays home all day.\n<BR><BR> In winter, the house needs to be heated.
        \ John and Jane use the system 200 disclosed herein to heat their house.  They
        define their preferred comfort levels using the GUI 209.  The system 200,
        for example, the occupancy pattern determination\nmodule 204 uses a proprietary
        algorithm to determine the living patterns of the occupants John, Jane and
        their dog Spot.  When John and Jane are away at work, the system 200 detects
        Spot as the only occupant of the house.  The system 200 determines that\nSpot
        is a non-human animate occupant and provides minimal control or no control
        of the environmental conditions of the house.  A few minutes before John arrives
        home, the system 200 starts heating the kitchen and living room of the house.
        \ When John\nenters the house at 5 p.m., the kitchen and living room of the
        house is already heated to the set temperature and comfort level, and John
        does not need to wait in the cold for the house to heat up.  John goes to
        the kitchen to wash the dishes.  While\nJohn is doing the dishes, the system
        200 does not heat the rest of the house apart from the kitchen and living
        room because there are no other occupancy zones 401 that are predicted to
        be occupied in the near future.\n<BR><BR> When Jane arrives home at 6 p.m.,
        the living room and the kitchen are already heated when she enters.  While
        Jane is cooking dinner, John is reading in the living room.  Hence, the system
        200 predictively heats both the kitchen and the living\nroom before occupancy
        by John and Jane.\n<BR><BR> After dinner, when John and Jane are watching
        TV in the living room, the system 200 stops heating the kitchen.  Shortly
        before 10 p.m., the system 200 starts heating the bedroom.  When John and
        Jane go to bed, the bedroom is already heated\naccording to their preferences.
        \ The temperature outside the house may drop very low at night and in the
        early morning.  The system 200 detects the drop in the outside temperature
        and increases heat provided to the bedroom to maintain the environmental\nconditions
        in the bedroom at the comfort levels of John and Jane.  The next morning when
        John and Jane both leave for work, the system 200 restarts conditioning the
        house till a few minutes before John's arrival at 5 p.m.\n<BR><BR> John and
        Jane seldom enter the basement, and hence the system 200 does not condition
        the basement.  If either John or Jane wishes to enter the basement, the system
        200 will detect the occupancy in the basement and start heating the basement.
        \ In\nthis case, there may be a period of time when John or Jane is in the
        basement and the temperature is not at an optimal level.  Alternatively, they
        may manually instruct the system 200 to heat the basement using the GUI 209
        before they enter the basement. Hence, John and Jane need not walk into an
        unconditioned room while using the system 200 disclosed herein.  Furthermore,
        if John and Jane start going to the basement frequently, the system 200 determines
        the behavior and proactively heats the basement\nbefore the arrival of John
        and Jane.  Therefore, the system 200 adapts to suit the living patterns of
        John and Jane without the intervention of John and Jane.\n<BR><BR> The system
        200 also controls environmental conditions other than temperature, for example,
        humidity.  Controlling other environmental conditions makes John and Jane
        feel comfortable even at a temperature a few degrees lower than the temperature\nthey
        would have been comfortable at. By lowering the temperature, the system 200
        reduces the energy consumed for conditioning the house.\n<BR><BR> It will
        be readily apparent that the various methods and algorithms described herein
        may be implemented in a computer readable medium appropriately programmed
        for general purpose computers and computing devices.  Typically a processor,
        for\nexample, one or more microprocessors will receive instructions from a
        memory or like device, and execute those instructions, thereby performing
        one or more processes defined by those instructions.  Further, programs that
        implement such methods and\nalgorithms may be stored and transmitted using
        a variety of media, for example, computer readable media in a number of manners.
        \ In one embodiment, hard-wired circuitry or custom hardware may be used in
        place of, or in combination with, software\ninstructions for implementation
        of the processes of various embodiments.  Thus, embodiments are not limited
        to any specific combination of hardware and software.  A \"processor\" means
        any one or more microprocessors, central processing unit (CPU) devices,\ncomputing
        devices, microcontrollers, digital signal processors or like devices.  The
        term \"computer readable medium\" refers to any medium that participates in
        providing data, for example instructions that may be read by a computer, a
        processor or a like\ndevice.  Such a medium may take many forms, including
        but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media.
        \ Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks and other
        persistent memory volatile media include\ndynamic random access memory (DRAM),
        which typically constitutes the main memory.  Transmission media include coaxial
        cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise a
        system bus coupled to the processor.  Common forms of computer\nreadable media
        include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic
        tape, any other magnetic medium, a compact disc-read only memory (CD-ROM),
        digital versatile disc (DVD), any other optical medium, punch cards, paper
        tape, any other\nphysical medium with patterns of holes, a random access memory
        (RAM), a programmable read only memory (PROM), an erasable programmable read
        only memory (EPROM), an electrically erasable programmable read only memory
        (EEPROM), a flash memory, any other\nmemory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave
        as described hereinafter, or any other medium from which a computer can read.
        \ In general, the computer readable programs may be implemented in any programming
        language.  Some examples of languages that can be\nused include C, C++, C#,
        Perl, Python, or JAVA.  The software programs may be stored on or in one or
        more mediums as an object code.  A computer program product comprising computer
        executable instructions embodied in a computer readable medium comprises\ncomputer
        parsable codes for the implementation of the processes of various embodiments.\n<BR><BR>
